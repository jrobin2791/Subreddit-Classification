The problem is that I'm having a really hard time finding sites where I can buy mixable/original versions of my favorite genres and tracks. In hardstyle it's very common for producers to release their so-called Original Mixes, but I'm not sure if that happens in other genres as well.

I've looked at sites like Beatport, and many of my favorite tracks are on there, but these are usually the same versions as on Spotify, which are not very suited for mixing. In hardstyle these would be called 'Radio edit'.


Soooo, do producers in other genres release Original mixes as well or is it a hardstyle thing only? If they do, where can I buy them?

For context, some of my favorite artists right now are Sam Feldt, RAMI, Campsite Dream, Hogland, Lucas Estrada, Robin Schulz, Hot Shade, Sigala. 

Sorry if this has been asked before. I've tried searching through the sub but I didn't really find an answer.

88,Looking for EDM albums with cohesion and emotion,"Hi all.

So I'm in a bit of a dilemma right now. My music taste has evolved over the last year or so in a way that sometimes frustrates me. In order for songs to give me more enjoyment now I usually have to feel a sense of emotion from them; except for special cases, just having a cool bass drop isnt enough, and this issue came to light especially when I began listening to EDM albums again. I realised that they all fell into the same trap of just being a bunch of songs, unrelated in both lyrics and structure, thrown together into an album. The songs were usually good individually, but together it was just a playlist. I've only been able to find a few EDM albums that fit my requirements of cohesion in a record:

*Porter Robinson - Worlds*: My favourite album of all time, because of the way it manages to have a sense of connection between the songs and puts emotion into the production instead of just the lyrics.

*San Holo - album1*: I love this record because of how it gets a set of emotions and runs you through them slowly, giving the album a sense of introspective progression. Essentially, it feels like an album.

*Illenium - Awake*: This is one of the few EDM albums that manages to have both awesome bass drops and a sense of progression. By putting the songs in an order that tell a story of falling out of a relationship and finding a new one, Illenium makes Awake feel like an album instead of a playlist.


Other examples of EDM albums I like because they flow well together are Zedd - Clarity and Madeon - Adventure, because the songs flow into eachother which makes them feel connected.


I know my demands are unreasonable, but the EDM world is huge, and I know there are artists out there making albums that have both emotional responses and actually feel like a connected record.

Recently obsessed with this new app that helps you make mixes, transitions and mashups with your Spotify Premium account. It will beat match for you automatically. It will even mix your playlists automatically. Very limited in terms of what you can to do with sampling and fading but still seems like something this community would enjoy a lot. Free trial and free to listen, kinda expensive after that but it's given me endless hours of entertainment.

Wanted to share two mixes I did recently that I'm really happy with and thought you guys would enjoy.  They're full of mashups that I made from scratch. First one is full of crowd pleasers. Second one is full of old school 2012-era bangers. Let me know what you guys think and hope you enjoy!

I recently stumbled across an old festival progressive house/big room playlist of mine from 2013 and felt very nostalgic.

I'm hoping to get some information from you guys regarding the definitions and requirements for certain sub-genres of EDM.

I'm looking for the encyclopedia on EDM.
And if we don't have it, shit I'll try to make my own but I need more sources and reports from individuals like yourselves.

It is played while the player is walking from the dugout (bench) to home plate for their next at-bat. Players chose their own walk-up music.

I've gotten into EDM in just the past year and a half or so, and have gotten tickets to see Above and Beyond at The Gorge here in Washington. My spouse and I are in our 40's, and are curious what we should expect? By that I mean age wise etc. For example we went to Demi Lovato a couple years ago and were by far the oldest in the audience. 

Also I don't know how big drugs are anymore in this culture but outside of a little weed and a glass of wine we don't engage, so will that set us apart as outsiders?

Finally, the show us listed to start at 2pm, which seems very odd as I'm used to concerts starting in the evening, so I'm guessing there are several openers?

Sorry if these are super newbie questions, and we're going regardless so don't be afraid to lay the truth on me! We just moved to Seattle a few months ago and have no friends, so are open to experiences outside our norm. Thanks!",EDM,1552600873,Princess_Nicole,11,23,True,2019-03-14

Because this is definitely where my interests are now, I was wondering what artists you all could recommend that feature drums + guitar + whatever else. I'm not just referring to a DJ that will ocassionaly solo over a beat, but rather an additional part of the performance. As an example I recently found out about David August + Ensemble and really really dig that sound. As a much older example I went to a Prodigy show years ago and it was awesome, as they had drums and guitar.

I also dug around in my old youtube playlists and came across a song I haven‚Äòt listened to in ages: [Summertime by Thijs852](https://youtu.be/CmPBGn7nLxo). It was released in 2012 and given away as a free download. Back when I discovered it, I thought it was an unreleased song by Avicii &amp; Basto called Cuchillo because there were a lot of uploads on youtube of the song under that name. As I now know, it is actually Thijs852 - Summertime which was shared around the internet under the false name Cuchillo by Avicii and Basto, probably because it really sounds like a song these two could have made back in the day.

Summertime is amazing, unfortunately the download link in the video description is expired. Seeing that it‚Äôs really an Avicii style track and there are many Avicii fans here, I hope there is someone here who downloaded the track back then and can share it with the rest of us since the quality of youtube rips is not that great.

It‚Äôs my happy place. It‚Äôs all I‚Äôve listened to for nearly 15 years. Festivals .. meh they‚Äôre cool. I‚Äôm happiest on a night club dance floor with the freaks, geeks, and weirdos. Ravers. I want to hear someone spin in a club for +5 hours and build a set. The problem is, I‚Äôve lived in my home town for 27 years and we have no scene. Aside from a handful of people out of town, I‚Äôve never had any friends to share my hobby with. I‚Äôve always traveled to shows, mostly alone, which is totally fine. I‚Äôve had loads of fun.

But...

I want to move closer to the people and culture I love dearly. I want to live somewhere where I can take my DJing hobby out of my bedroom on yhe weekends, even if self promoted for friends - (Not trying to get famous). Though I‚Äôm also thinking realistically. Cost of living, job market, etc. I‚Äôve still got to make a career. I just really want to have a dance floor on my back doorstep and friends to share my hobby with. Where would this community recommend I go and look for a job?

Places I‚Äôve been &amp; have some idea about:

Miami/FL - The disingenuous nature of the area concerns me. I rather dislike mainstage EDM and the pretentious side of the scene. I want to be around music lovers, not novelty seekers. Though perhaps I‚Äôm misinformed!

Chicago - I‚Äôve been to Sound-Bar and Spybar on many occasions. Incredible bookings all the time. The Midwest is the birthplace of dance music. The rising cost of living &amp; weather are a concern. 

Dallas - Seems to have a thriving scene. Cost of living seems reasonable. Near the top of my list.

Atlanta - I‚Äôve seen Max Graham spin here twice. I‚Äôve went to Counter-Point years ago. I know they had a thriving scene 5-10 years ago. Not really sure of its current state. Cost of living about on par with Dallas.

Places I know nothing about:

Detroit
Seattle
Portland
Denver
Austin
Phoenix

Too expensive for me to really consider:
LA
SF
NYC

Just no:
Las Vegas

I‚Äôm open to any suggestions not on this list as well. I‚Äôll take all the input I can get.


Any advice would be very much appreciated!!

I would honestly move to Berlin if it wasn‚Äôt so damn hard to get a work visa w/o knowing someone with an in. That town seems like my kind of people. Eccentrics just being themselves.

365,Featured Artist of the Week No. 26 - Mr. Carmack,"Hi r/edm! Welcome to the next installment of the Weekly Featured Artist Post. Our featured artist this week is Mr. Carmack!

Mr. Carmack is one of the most revered trap producers in electronic music with a penchant for creative and intricate percussion and fusion of heavier and soulful elements in tracks. An incredibly talented and prolific producer, Mr. Carmack has produced a wide array of sounds: hip-hop-influenced dance floor bangers, chill future beats, and heavy percussion intensive trap. With only a handful of true peers in the trap and beats scene, Mr. Carmack has been looked to frequently as a taste maker in the more underground elements of the beats scene, particularly with his ties to future beats collective Soulection, trap collective Team Supreme, and the late LA institution Low End Theory. For his influence and impact on the music scene, his place in the Pantheon of Trap is unquestionable. Check out his music below:

**Weekly Recap**

Those of you in the bass music community will probably be very familiar with the first artist this week. Axel Boy has carved a name for himself as a dubstep producer on labels like Never Say Die and Buygore. However, he also ventures into the house realm from time to time with tracks like 2017's *Wild &amp; Free* and his latest addition to the Boof Files, *Jump Out*. This track is an excellent expose on his versatility as a producer, incorporating melodic synths alongside his normal bass wobbles, culminating is a fiery tune that is sure to have dance floors everywhere moving.

Building on their 2017 breakout hit, *Oxygen*, Tommy Trash and i_o have reunited again, this time under the mau5trap label, to produce a new tune, *Let Me Go*. Combining Tommy Trash's aptitude for banging house tunes with i_o's up and coming progressive and techno influenced sounds, *Let Me Go* is a worthy successor to *Oxygen* that will surely be making it's rounds come festival season.

OVer the past 2 years, Elypsis has cemented himself as an artist on the Silk Music label. Joining forces with Taglo, their new split EP Swimming With Sirens is no exception. This EP features a collaboration from the two, as well as a solo track by both artists. *Swimming With Sirens* is a melodic progressive house track that builds a great atmosphere before bringing in a harmonizing guitar track for the climax that really pushes the track over the edge. Likewise, Elypsis' production *Dear Scorpio* is peaceful to the core, producing a calming atmosphere that we've come to know him for. For his solo track, Taglo elected to slow things down a little, producing a track with a much deeper sounds, from a watery bass lines to haunting background vocals. Be sure to check out all the whole EP if you are fan of progressive house!

It's not a new week without some new trance music. This week saw new tracks from the likes of Factor B, James Dymond, Andrew Manning, Orla Feeney, and Jordan Suckley all ready to ignite dance floors. Starting with Jordan Suckley, who was given the opportunity to remix Tiesto &amp; Armin van Buuren's classic, *Wonder?*. Remixing a classic like this tune and giving it your own flair, while maintaining the sounds of the original is always a complex process. However, in this case, Suckley hit the nail on the head, updating the tune to 2019 with huge synths that encapsulate the song in a modern shell, while preserving the qualities that make it a classic. Give it a listen and let me know what you think!

Andrew Manning is a name that many people may not be familiar with, but his latest EP, Magnum Opus / Daydreamer, his debut on Manuel LeSaux's Extrema label. *Magnum Opus* is a massive uplifting track with vibes similar to Aly &amp; Fila. Combining a big kick with a echoing melody, *Magnum Opus* isn't the most unique track ever produced, but it's sound encapsulates the modern uplifting trance style. *Daydreamer* is much of the same, with a huge uplifting melody reminiscent of the best in the genre, that seamlessly melds the happy and somber emotions evoked by trance music.

**Tune of the Week**

This week's Tune of the Week comes from a rising star in the hardcore community, Lil Texas. Hailing from America, Lil Texas is on a mission to put hardcore on the map in America. His newest track, *Anthem X* is a wonderful mix of new school hardcore and old school rave sounds. Featuring classic rave stabs, gritty hardcore kicks, and aggressive industrial percussion, *Anthem X* seeks to carve out a new wave of hardcore music in America. Give it a listen and let me know what you think, and leave your track of the week in the comments.

That's all for this week's update. As always, be sure to check the Boof Files playlist for all the latest updates in electronic music, as well as some classic hits and leave your favorite tunes from this week in the comments. Have a great week and we'll see you next Sunday!

Pretty much as the title says. Around  February 4th, 2018 I bought a Launchpad Pro. I got access to Ableton Live and quickly put together a track. It's not too good now that I look  back at it, but some close still friends love it :)

I  was planning to put out an Electro House track on Feb 4th this year,  but day job and stuff, you know it, missing deadlines happens to everyone :)  So, I'm putting it out today :) Listen and enjoy (and give feedback  please, I really need feedback!)

I feel like I‚Äôm not quite allowed to say I‚Äôm part of the EDM community/culture because I‚Äôve not been to festivals or anything much more than that.

It is suggested you listen to the song whilst reading my list of ailments so the song becomes much a little more impressive of a listening experience. ( sad face )

&amp;#x200B;

You should see the number of files on my computer from exporting the final mix so many times. I would stay up until 5 a.m. at times grinding out the project, just to stop having to worry about it.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I mixed and mastered it using only stock FL studio plugins

\-I designed every synth sound with my own two hands using serum 

\-If my PC for some reason shuts down during the night or my dad unplugs it while I'm at school to ""save energy"" I would immediately lose all my hard work

\-I wasn't able to take any breaks off the project when I got a writers block

\-Being away from my room with the project open in general made me a little nervous because at any point in time my work could be erased 

\-In order to make unique patterns (u FL goons know what I mean) I would have to get a new pattern and merge it with an existing one

\-vocals and vocal chops and any type of wav sample were hell to deal with because of not being able to make unique patterns

Yes he plays all his tracks but there‚Äôs no mixing or anything going on, I love his music so it makes up for it but all he does is play his track‚Äôs 1st snd /nd drop over and over again.

Midnight T is another artist. I‚Äôve seen him live and he doesn‚Äôt get enough credit. The dude goes hard. He did tour with NGHTMRE on the Christmas tour so he got some publicity then and he‚Äôs going on a spring/summer tour in 2019 so I think he will get up there.

Seriously though, what other festival is there where I'm able to spend the day on the beach listening to great music, CONSTANTLY bump into artists, listen to sets until 6AM, have easy access to my room for drinks and power naps, grab expensive free food right next to the stage, and have a lady say ""washy washy"" before squirting hand sanitizer into my hands?? I really do hope that I find something better, because it must be amazing if it beats that. Can't wait to do it again next year!

Oh and btw that sunrise set was amazing. It was incredible seeing that many people so hyped at 7AM as the sun came up. I never thought that i'd rage to Claude Vonstroke for a sunrise and shake my ass to Big Freedia in the same day, but it happened...",EDM,1547170783,bxc_thunder,58,1,True,2019-01-10

[Last Week's Recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDM/comments/adc4gk/the_boof_files_2019_week_1_11_15/)

[The 2019 Boof List](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4BYHddr8MfgMfmfBYWrmGX?si=x0B_83DUQ9iwPUqYxlpd8w)

**Weekly Recap**

The first full week of 2019 saw a big step up in release quality from the previous, with 20 songs joining The Boof Files, from artists like Deadmau5, Gammer, Terry De Libra, and Luttrell. 

Tinlicker followed up their latest single, *About You*, with an EP of the same name on Mau5trap. A strong effort from cover to cover, the third track, *Less Than a Minute* joins the title track in The Boof Files due to it's driving melody and darker tonality. This whole EP is a treat that any fan of progressive house will not want to pass up.

Stereo Underground scored a hit in 2017 with their track *Flashes*. This week, the track has been given four excellent remixes by the likes of D-Nox, Beckers, and Navar. However, my personal favorites on the packages have to be the remixes by Gai Barone and Stereo Underground himself. In his remix, Gai Barone strips the track to it's core elements, creating a minimalistic progressive house track drenched in raw emotion and atmospheric sounds. For his remix, Stereo Underground chose to follow a similar suit by lowering the BPM and creating an ambient masterpiece that showcases his flexibility as an artist. Give the whole package a listen and let me know what your favorite was in the comments!

Terry De Libra is kicking off his 2019 with *Melodia*, a 3 track EP that is an early candidate for EP of the year. The title track is amelodic journey littered with vocal chops that creates an uplifting sound. The second track, *Nightfall* is a tasteful follow up which utilizes plucks to create a less airy, more soothing vibe that carries on throughout the track. The final track, a remix of 2016's *Anagenesis* large synths and more aggressive sound, in favor of creating a much more melodic track that will have you dancing all night.

Deadmau5 once again joins The Boof Files, this week with his track for the Polar soundtrack, *Midas Heel*. Keeping with the dark noir themes of the film, *Midas Heel* utilizes a syncopated  beat that creates an ominous aura, accented with dark symphonic elements. In addition, the release contains a vocal version of the track with Lights.

**Tune of the Week**

This week's Tune of the Week comes to us from Luttrell, who released the title track to his debut album *Into Clouds* this week. *Into Clouds* like the other cuts we've heard thus far, *Quiet Even Dark* and *Out Of Me*, is a fantastic track of deep bass lines, floating synths, and beautiful orchestral arrangements that is sure to bring you into the clouds. Check out this excellent release and keep an eye out for his record, out February 1st on Anjunadeep.

That's all for this weeks write-up, but be sure to check out the full Boof Files playlist for all of the latests updates! Have a great week and let me know some of your favorite tracks or things I've missed in the comments!

In his [Voyage Mix](https://soundcloud.com/galimatias/voyage-mix03), he played two more songs that have yet to be released and since then has fallen off the grid. 

Since Urban Flora was released with Alina Baraz, he has been one of my favorite producers who I think is completely underrated. It would be a shame to not see him continue making music.",EDM,1547406812,TheWorstRoommate,2,1,True,2019-01-13

49,Featured Artist of the Week No. 22 - George FitzGerald,"Hi r/edm! Welcome to the next installment of the Weekly Featured Artist Post. Our featured artist this week is George FitzGerald!

British producer George FitzGerald has a knack for making emotive, melancholic house music that is simultaneously club-ready and perfect for chill-out rooms. His productions of late, including his third studio album, All That Must Be (2018), are dreamlike and intimate featuring atmospheric sounds and wistful ambiance. FitzGerald‚Äôs music, however, doesn‚Äôt sacrifice energy at the cost of his melancholic melodies - his own work featured prominently in both his Ibiza sets and his 2018 BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix.

George FitzGerald has melded his environmental influences of Berlin clubs, bustling London neighborhoods, and sleepy country towns into a cohesive style, at once danceable and elegant. Check out his music below:

108,"Anyone know why almost all EDM tracks (or popular have English lyrics), and why no big names coming out of countries like China that have huge populations","Is it just simply because these artists are appealing to a large audience base (English speakers)?  It seems that even before some large non native-English speaking producers became popular their tracks were also in English.  Also on that note, why have we not seen any big names come out of countries like India and China with huge populations?  I understand that they probably don't have the same culture surrounding EDM music, but you could also argue that USA, Mexico, amongst others don't have it at the forefront of their culture.  Also, with such a large population, you would think at least one of the DJs/producers from these countries would be cracking DJ Mags top 100 or becoming popular.",EDM,1544493731,runescapemaster111,6,1,True,2018-12-10

^excuse my musical lingo I‚Äôm relatively new to this stuff 

I feel like many artists strive to be like dimension and Wilkinson and just don‚Äôt get the balance quite right

My favourite songs by dimension and wilkinson include:

-generator
-love to me
-desire (the dimension remix)
-afterglow
-sweet lies
-takes you higher
-dirty love 

Another artist I‚Äôve also gotten into is loadstar which gives me similar vibes

  Due to various reasons (tinnitus being the main one - take care of your ears folks) I've not been listening to much music for the last few years and feel completely lost in terms of whats been the highlights and is really worth a listen.

I still cant quite manage bangers or really loud EDM as it hurts my ears but i do, on occasion, play a bit of Underworld / Prodigy because they're worth a bit of pain now and again.

However, i've always been a fan of Downtempo / Chill / IDM anyway and a more chilled approach at lower volumes seems to be ok on my ears.

Past favourites include (but not limited too obviously):-

Biosphere

Boards of Canada (I fucking love BOC)

Kruder + Dorfmeister

Jon Hopkins

Future Sound of London

Four tet

139,"I don't understand the hype of festival progressive for the past year or so. They feel formulaic as compared to 2010 to 2012. If they want ""#progressive"" back, they really need to change up things. What are your thoughts?","With the announcement of Swedish House Mafia's return to the mainstage and abundance of breakbeat electronic music (trap, future bass, etc), producers as of late (especially from Revealed &amp; Protocol) have been taking the opportunity to produce and hype up bigroom/festival progressive house music. But I just can't get into it. I feel a lot of the tracks sound soulless (not having individual character) and have a obvious radio-pop sound to it (inserting vocals and keeping it really short). There is hardly any true buildups or sense of anticipation and use of signature sounds. Maybe cause I analyze things quickly and I get tired of it immediately but has anyone noticed this? Examples:

* All which is followed with a repeated vocals from the intro as breakdown. It all feels like I heard this before from somewhere. The tracks below this feel a whole different level and seem they took their time to achieve the true uplifting feel.

286,San Holo Album1 Tour Review: 12/12/18 (Salt Lake City),"Alright everybody, I just got back home from San Holo‚Äôs Album1 tour at The Complex in SLC and I just thought I would give some honest opinions of the performance...

Openers: The openers for this show were Eastghost, Duskus, and Taska Black. Overall I was actually very impressed with all three of them. Eastghost in particular threw down some nasty beats and even with limited lighting and audio abilities (being the opener of the night obviously he is unable to have full force with light shows, subs, etc.) he managed to give a really good performance and get the crowd pretty into his showing. Duskus provided exactly what I expected and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Taska Black came out with more energy then I felt like San Holo did. He came out with a solid lift show and did some amazing remixes (his remix of ‚ÄòAll I Do Is Win‚Äô definitely had the crowd moving and dancing). Overall this was honestly some of the most fun I‚Äôve ever had with openers since getting into the EDM scene. All three came out with a lot of energy and it felt like they had something to prove. By the end of Black‚Äôs set I was very energized and hyped for the show to go on. 

San Holo‚Äôs Set: San Holo‚Äôs Album1 tour defiantly hyped up Salt Lake City, as he came on stage announcing that the show was sold out. Production wise I was pretty impressed. This wasn‚Äôt my first time seeing him and he has defiantly up‚Äôd his budget for lighting and sound quality. When it comes to his actual performance...this is were I am torn. I love His music and I believe that he defiantly has potential to eventually headline some major festivals in the future. However, I feel like he needs to work on his crowd interaction and overall decide what kind of DJ he wants to be. His songs were constantly switching from what could have been very vibey and chill to a full out rock guitar? The transition between was NOT smooth and felt forced and choppy. The entire show felt this way and many of the people around me seemed to get almost bored with the lack of power and force behind his drops. It felt like he would have these amazing and beautiful build up‚Äôs, just to have them completely broken down by the interruption of a rock in roll guitar over his usually melodic beats. Overall I still had a good time and enjoyed the performance, but I truly think he needs to pick one: the guitar sound or full on DJ sets. Because together they are nothing to write home about. 

Conclusion: Overall I would give this performance a 6.5/10. The openers defiantly have bright futures ahead of them and I would really love to see EastGhost and Taska Black in different settings than this. As for San Holo, I believe that his potential is as high as he sets for himself. If he finds a way to incorporate this guitar sound in a smoother and more melodic fashion I would love to keep him keep it. Yet, if he wants to go for the heavier DJ sound I think that the guitar needs to go. I would recommend this show to anybody who was able to get tickets for a low price ($30 or under), but I would NOT pay 3rd party seller prices for San Holo.

304,Electric Family Screwed Me Over.. STAY AWAY,"I've never dealt with anything like this.

So I bought a 10-pack of combo bracelets for &gt; $80 from them (all as presents for my friends). I noticed the GWN one was out of stock, but could still be purchased in the combo for some reason so I got it. It's the only dubstep act my one friend really likes so I got it for him as his b-day gift. 2 weeks go by and nothing... no order confirmation... no shipping... no email saying your order has been delayed... JUST NON-STOP PROMOTIONAL EMAILS...nothing of substance. I email them inquiring about my order. As expected they tell me ""there were manufacturing issues with a few bracelets in your order"" aka the GWN was out of stock and we accidentally sold you one. I say that's fine just send me what you have and send the rest later that's all I want. They even agreed to toss a tchami bracelet in for me. Then when they sent the order they just subbed my GWN one for Tchami and I got the package. I got shipping info when it sent and everything... awesome they got their shit together, right? Nah, they must've just hoped I'd forget about it or something because I never received an order-related email for another month. I reached back out and they told me it shipped but was forwarded to a different address and I should reach out to USPS. What the fuck... 2 MONTHS FOR A BRACELET (and this was the one that motivated me to start buying these for my friends in the first place). I got the first order and the address was right, plus it's literally just a normal house. So obviously EF fucked up and put the wrong shipping info on and have now gone radio silent. They won't respond to me at all and it just really rubs me the wrong way. They pretend to be about giving back, but honestly didn't give a fuck about me... they just kept hoping I'd forget about it... Never have I ever received worse customer service for how quick they were to originally respond. Anyone else have similar experiences? I know I'm being a diva, but I care about my friends, and I actually spent a lot of money on their products.

320,"Who's the most underrated, underappreciated EDM artist in your music library, and why?","Pretty straight forward. What artist do you think deserves way more attention that they receive and why?

&amp;#x200B;

For me, it's [Savant](https://savantofficial.bandcamp.com/). 

Savant is a treasure trove of incredibly unique and complex EDM. His style is unlike anything I've ever heard before.

""Savant"" is just one of Aleksander Vinter's many personas. Savant is his EDM centered name, but hes got many more that span many genres. But that doesn't stop ""Savant"" from having influences from other genres.

He takes inspiration from every genre, ***every*** genre, and mixes it in with his EDM songs. In the middle of an electronic death metal song? Throw in some 80s funk. Heavy complex dubstep song? Get some god damn harpsichord solos in there. He doesn't follow the conventional rules for how music should be made, he does what he wants, how he wants it and releases it. And he does it well. Its not just haphazardly thrown together for the sake of being different, its done in a way that meshes very different things. The product are albums full of originality.

His music is incredibly complex as well. As his name suggests, [hes a savant](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/savant) and his specialty is music. As a result, he creates music composed so creative and complex in a way that I can't imagine anyone else coming up with. I have no doubt in my mind that if Savant was born in the 18th century, he'd have been the Mozart of the time. 

And finally, you know what the best part is? He's released a *lifetime* of music in \~7 years. Hes released 20 albums, each with \~15 songs. The man claims to have created over 10,000 songs in his lifetime. ^(what I wouldn't give to have an ipod with all of that loaded onto it.)

I think that he deserves way more recognition that he gets. I've yet to find an artist as unique and complex as him.

Finally, if you haven't heard of him, here are a few tracks that I'd highly recommend checking out:

[Starfish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1UzSAbMYIs) \- [Melody Circus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IihP1I550rU) \- [Sledgehammer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JawRInQ-0fw) \- [Jester](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKsZh-LS4E0) \- [Wildstyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBL_6hZWXx4) \- [Princess of Zion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzUHkf02PTY)

&amp;#x200B;

329,Deadmau5's reply to a fan,"Dear Joel,



I realize that you are not the same producer, mentally, that produced Faxing Berlin wayyy back. You have grown, or rather, regressed into a boorish, immature rockstar; the model that I would like to think an EDM producer would avoid.



However, it is deeply troubling to me that you could call all DJs ""cunts"". I am saddened and upset by this, not because I am a DJ, but because I am sure YOU were a DJ at one point in your career. Have you forgotten what it's like to maybe go hungry for a little bit to get a new mixer, to dig through some crates of records to stumble across a release you wanted for months, to get people going with that great mix you practiced for a week?


I am scared, because, YOU influence young people. Not sane, sober, artistic minds; YOUR drug-riddled, shrinking brain controls thousands (maybe millions) of screaming teens and tweens. Instead of inspiring these minds to go and pick up a turntable/CDJ/whatever, you are telling them to go and get fucked up and party; I imagine your mentality is along the lines of ""don't worry about making music, i've got it covered.""


Unfortunately, that mentality of shutting down new ideas for your own production's benefit will NOT help in the long run. Because, frankly, we need role models in the scene; your comments set us back, and make us all look bad.


Have a great day,

Some Guy

In response:

If by ""my friends"" you mean people who would also insinuate that im a drug addicted egomaniac who put himself up on a pedestal for all the electronic musical world¬† to look up at, then i do believe they can go fuck themselves as well.

i can already tell you exactly what you know about me as a person... i dont have to sit here and wait for you to read a handful of stupid interviews and come back to me with your own verdict. Outside of my craft, i can already tell you that you don't actually know a thing about me. Which is perfectly fine by me, providing i don't have to be subjected to your fucking ramblings of a malformed role model you make me out to be based on a few snippets of internets here and there.

whether im globally conceived to be, or not, i don't aspire to be a role model, and i dont aspire to be a leader, prophet or all around advocate of anything other than ""the silly shit i get up to when im in my element"" which, ironicly enough, just so happens to be making music. Youll find this is probably a very common attribute to nearly anyone with even a hint of artistic freedom and an audience whos willing to listen.

so as for my comments making ""us all look bad"" do keep in mind that i am not a part of ""us"" and until the government intervenes or Cthulhu says otherwise, my career and life is pretty much run under a firm dictatorship by yours truly, and is not a fucking democracy. Ergo, people like you *can* freely chime in your two cents with your two opinions, and i can guarantee im probably not going to give a shit one way or another.

why respond? well... the thing that upsets me here is that people (today it's you) believe that theres still an element of ""your doing it wrong"" when it comes how i consciously choose to do things in a field that is supposed to be FAR from governed by outside sources, pka ""the rest of us""

If this is something that scares you, then go be scared. If it's something that inspires you, then be inspired, and if its something you don't give a shit about, then dont give a shit. But for the love of god, don't put the self-rightous ""you came from a low place and now you think youre the shit"" rant on me. If i had a nickle for every time this has ever been said behind my back, i would be able to afford my own country by now.

THE MORE YOU KNOW.

now go email this same rant to the thousands of other successful artists who worked their way to the top of the fuckin EDM food chain from their mothers basements and have developed massive, justified delusions of grandeur, compile the replies, and make a fucking coffee table book so i can learn something about myself that i didn't already fucking know from some complete fucking stranger.

445,"Been out of the scene for a while, what are some of the classics of the past 5 years?","My favorite era of EDM was from 2009 to 2012. They were my early teen years (13-16), so that may play a part in this, but my heart tells me it was the most mainstream at the time for a reason, because the music was fucking phenomenal. It seemed like everyday, left and right, a new classic was being made. Levels, Save the World, In My Mind, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, Cinema (Skrillex Remix), The Way We See the World, Spaceman, No Beef, Bass Cannon, Adventure Club Remixes, Raise Your Weapon, I Can't Stop, We Found Love, Don't You Worry Child, Language, Strobe, Clarity, I mean the list goes on and on. Around 2015 I lost interest in EDM, because it seemed to have lost its soul and became generic and trap/pop dominiated. DJ Snake and Marshmello are pretty good (and The Chainsmokers have a few gems), but overall today I just don't see the music getting made like it used to be, but maybe I'm just getting old or I've been out of the scene for too long or I'm just too blind to see it.

461,Deadmau5 on what it means to be a celebrity,"""Someone once asked me to come up with a series of anecdotes or a couple paragraphs on what it means to be a celebrity.... i sometimes wonder about that. Not that i lose any fuckin sleep over it, but from time to time i stop to think about it for a second.

The term celebrity is clearly defined as¬†a¬†famous¬†orwell-known¬†person basicly, but i think the word takes on alternate meanings to others, for me... it just means pressure. Every now and again i keep having these moments where im sitting back and thinking like i used to think back when i was a teenager, and looking back on it, i was never really under any abnormal pressure from anything other than the obvious ""what am i going to do when i get older, how am i going to get through school, when am i going to move out of the house....""¬† I didnt have some idea glued on my brain that i was going to become a musician, that was just my hobby. So, the pressure wasnt really anything out of the ordinary... still stressful at times nonetheless tho, but everybody gets that.

Things started to get a little scarier when i left my home in Niagara Falls to head up to Toronto and work for an IT company... as it should have anyway. My first apartment, so the pressure was doing well at work and making rent. I kinda blindly went into it really, learning my responsibilities as an ""adult"" on the fly... we all know they don't offer courses on growing up and becoming independant, so i wasnt any different then the next little noob who left the nest.

Things seemed to be going okay, the dust settled and autopilot kicked in... the pressure was pretty much reduced at that point. I had gotten into the routine. getting up, going to work, eating lunch at bourbon st. grill, and heading back to work, finishing up, heading home at 6 or 7ish and then just milling away on the computer making weird little glitch tunes for a bit. Rinse, repeat, go get retarded on weekends.

fast forward 2 years later. Well, my contracts up... i've gotten a good taste of the grownup world, and im pretty sure i can handle it... so since im a free agent, i went back to niagara falls to live at home again and take a stab at possibly starting my own media design company... pressures back on. Got a few freelance jobs, a couple of regular clients, nothing that could help me drop a mortgage or anything... which started to corncern me a little... i wasn't getting any younger, and alot of my friends more or less had some kind of shit locked down....or at least moved up the broken ladder of awesomeness in the ranking system over at the fuckin parks commision or marineland.¬†*thumbs up*

so yeah, that was kinda scary... and the pressure was back on... so it was time to sit down and write a list of shit i think im good at (or wanted to be). Of course music was in there, as was media design (flash, photoshoop, CSS, php, 3d shit) I wanted to be one of those really hip and trendy New York / SF coder / design gurus... ¬† like Eric Jordan or the badass himself Josh Davis... those were the kinda people i wanted to be, professionally speaking of course. I was practical enough in my desicion i suppose... i am / was too much of a pessimist to state that i wanted to be a mother fuckin rockstar and make millions of dollars just making music and touring the world. I couldn't / wouldn't allow myself dream that big... not because i couldnt imagine how awesome it would have been, but only because i didnt want to see myself being 35 and still sitting at my moms house chasing that dream. The avoidance of failure was probably my biggest motivator at the time.

So, on my quest to develop ""sick media design skills"" i will say, i've learned alot about everything... design, programming, presentation... all while still whittling away on music to kill the time. Im not exactly sure what the definning moment was for me... but there was a bit of a paradigm shift when i found myself making music... for a company that sells music to TV commercials, website developers, and other dudes who didnt feel like paying $30,000 to liscense ""whoop there it is"" for their fuckin tampon commercials or whatever. And, even though the money wasnt insane... i was having fun, and i was making music nearly fulltime now.

i'd love to write about the following year, but im still pretty bitter about it... so maybe it will come up in a book somewhere in the future.... so here's the tl;dr on that:

moved back to toronto, worked with someone, Chris Lake found me.

Chris had heard a couple snippets of some house (or whatever my genre is) tracks i've been toying about with, and was really keen on em... (i think it was faxing berlin) ... this opened up a whole new world to me really... i mean, i didnt realize that people at the time were actually making a modest living off dance music alone, never have in fact. I always assumed that they all had day jobs, trust funds, or rich ass wives... i really did... because every musician i ever knew growing up still lived with their fuckin parents or somewhere downtown with their girlfriend who's been trying to unload them.

funny. alright, i figured i'd look into this a little more seriously, and see what pans up... well, talking to Chris got me talking to others, Max Graham was always a big supporter from the very begninning, in fact, he named ""Faxing Berlin"" over an aim conversation... he just didnt know it at the time ;)¬† and well, he was going to sign it and put it out on his new label ReBranded (which was a huge fuckin deal for me at the time).... the deal was really insanely simple (as far as recording deals go) yet someone still managed to fuck it up so terribly bad that it just completley put him off the idea alltogether, which i totally understand.

So... that kinda just came and went... so did the rest of that fucking year. so, i moved again, just to a different part of Toronto... started up a niche label on beatport called mau5trap! Of course, by this time, Pete Tong had been canning out ""faxing berlin, not exactly"" so the label was doing pretty allright... so now it was official. I started to accept and get a little more comfortable with the idea that i just might be doing this the rest of my life... but i still had no idea what to expect... and was still as pessimistic as always. But, realisticly it was looking safe, Nic Fanciulli and Zabiella were doing their one+one tour, and rinsing faxing berlin.... then all of a sudden im googling myself... and im seeing this ""deadmau5"" guy being talked about a little bit here and there... all VERY underground... which is cool to the scenesters no doubt. Then along came satan... who is a ginger, and made me sign a management agreement.


nawwww.... im kidding. It's just Dean, people confuse him for beazelbub all the time... no seriously, it was a cozy little safe deal (for both parties) that was to just help me along the way, book me some shows, help out with the label... nothing insanely heavy... coz im sure for all he knew at the time i was just a flash in the pan... and for all i knew at the time i was just a flash in the pan... so im sure we were all pretty cautious... even though he'd probably spout off some bullshit now like ""I KNEW HE'D BE BIG"" whatever dean... youre still the same dean i met in a fucking SHED near a horse pen in Kent... so calm down. (hes probably read this and shat himself by now)

So on came not exactly, arguru, the reward is cheese... (which by the way deserves a chapter all on its own, but im not fond of litigation so i'll omit that as well) and well... the bookings just kinda came in... and next thing i know, is that im on flights to england, australia, malta... to be the support acts of some pretty big names at the time in EDM. So i think this is where the pressure started to kick in. It's really a tough thing to be thrown in the same arena as some other people who are doing way better than you... I mean, fuck yeah it's exciting, but the expectations of you that you throw on yourself are bigger than anything you can imagine.

Cue my fear of failure... my first ""show"" ever... was headlinning the main room at Ministry Of Sound, in London... at the time, it wasnt really clear to me... but closer to the date, i was told that there are alot of producers who have worked / produced for years and years who haven't gotten to that point. This was a royal headfuck for me... and i was a nervous wreck. I remeber getting up there that night, playing after nic fanciulli, shaking like a fuckin leaf... praying my shit worked, laptop didnt crash, or just fuck something up royally... it was really the ""this is it"" moment for me. baptism by fire no doubt. i will say now, ever since that show, i have never been nervous about performing again.

from that point on to this point, my life could be tracked online... it was just...¬† more tracks, more recognition, and way more touring... with the odd bit of bullshit and stuff in between. There really was a point in those years where i could have sworn my ""celebrity"" status was at the perfect level for me.... i could still go to any given nightclub and have a great time with friends, not get bothered by press too much, nothing controversial going on, just chilling making music havin fun.... and on the other side... while still having people turn up to events just to see me. It was amazing, and i really regret not being more relaxed about it.

now my life seems unreal even to myself... im sitting here typing this away, in a fucking gorgeous private villa in ibiza, you know, the usual... just working on some shit for MTV, hanging out with sweedish house mafia....tiesto, guetta... ... like what the fuck is wrong with me? how does anyone just get ""used"" to this shit...i can't. i won't. the only thing that's keeping my feet on the ground right now is pressure. You know that feeling you get when people are watching you? yeah... well what if the feeling was justified, and you have nearly 1,000,000 followers on facebook alone, and 1.2 BILLION who are going to watch you on TV in 2 weeks time... i dont know how im able to cope with that kind of pressure....fuck, how does anyone else cope with it? what about i dunno... the other guys in my feild... i don't bother to ask.. because i already know it has to be different for everyone. But for me... it's scary as fuck... the scary part isn't the attention youre getting, the scariest part is the instilled fear of failure that i've had my whole life.... and when you can't live up to someones expectations, that classifies as a fail.

the only thing left to do is to try to ignore the fact that people expect things from you at this point.... but again, it's pretty hard to ignore a million people. It's just a big headfuck for me... for the most part, i try not to let the pressure build on me to the point where i fumble around like an idiot... but thats just what happens. Remeber that Brittany shit when she went all fuckin loco and shaved her head? yeah i thought it was fuckin hilarious at the time too... but, thinking about it... i can totally see that as a direct result of just cracking under the stress... not to say everyone who's under huge amounts of pressure and stress are ceceptable to flipping the fuck out and shaving their head... but everyone has a breaking point.... and i dont think i ever want to know mine.

So am i living a dream? or enduring a nightmare?¬† I still can't decide... because the last thing i want, or anyone else wants, is to just fade out into obscurity over a period of time and then end up shit on by the people who are near me now. Thats why i have ""fail"" tatooed on the inside of my wrist... has a very profound meaning to me. Well, this is the short of it...another day approaches, and the pressure is more prevalent then it was the other day... im trying my best""",EDM,1544808083,Daedalus_Daw,3,1,True,2018-12-14

Jason Miller Accel: 
a long but interesting album. Every track is gold but hard to pin down a genre. It starts in a house/dubstep/drum and bass place, goes to techno/chiptune/electroswing then random synthwave &amp; 90's house and ends in trance/orchestra. If you've ever thought an artist sounds the same across too many tracks this is the album for you with an artist that changes sounds every track and sometimes mid-track and somehow makes it work as a package.

When certain drops hit my body feels like it is exploding with emotion. My breathing will stagger and force me to inhale sharply. I also get shivers over my entire body from head to toe of pure excitement. My eyes (probably) dilate temporarily because they feel amazing too. Omg though the shivers/goosebumps thing feels SO DAMN GOOOOD!!! Like wtf is this music! It‚Äôs fking CRAZY! I feel like a B.E.A.S.T. on edm oml ppl it‚Äôs so good.

I can‚Äôt even explain with words the way some songs make me feel. This feeling is 10x more powerful than a hit of coke. And it probably ties with smashing a hot chick.

The feeling usually peaks for 10 seconds and remains at a pretty high level for at least 20 seconds, sometimes way more if I‚Äôm really feeling it.

The way those beats hit you is LIKE BEING THROWN OFF A FKING MOUNTAIN PEOPLE. Omgggg üòÇ. Those funky sounds and beats just hit you like a truck.

I‚Äôm on top of the fuking world when I get this feeling. No one can stop me. I‚Äôm a fking GOD.

Omfg someone please tell me I‚Äôm not alone. Edm is really something else. It‚Äôs by far my favorite genre and also it‚Äôs the only type of music I listen to when I have a choice. Don‚Äôt get me wrong other genres are nice but edm is just something else entirely.

Also no I‚Äôm not high. I‚Äôm serious.

If you don‚Äôt get the shivers from music I actually feel really bad for you. It‚Äôs one of the most pleasurable things I can feel.

65,A tip if you're stuck thinking of rhythms,"go here [http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/morse-code/](http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/morse-code/)

type in a word

convert to morse. 

play around with different words until you find a good rhythm. Example: ""testing"" translates to ""- . ... - .. -. --.""  
Implement that into a beat or melody. Honestly, couldn't think of anything to do so decided to try this, and it has given me a couple of ideas. Hope this helps some people :) ",EDM,1541873568,-Piano-,2,1,True,2018-11-10

69,"Saying trance is one of the best genres does not mean ""gatekeeping"".","I'm absolutely sick of this toxic tribal cult you guys call ""EDM"". I can't even say that trance is probably the best genre without being attacked. 

First of all you overly sensitive twats, it's a fact that trance was the backbone of ""EDM"". Simply saying no one could top off classic tiesto or Paul van dyk, does not mean I am a toxic gatekeeper. You can look at YouTube and just see the comments on all the classics. The problem I have is that you guys don't appreciate that music. 

Can you guys have some genre diversity?? All I see in this fucking group is ""illenium, porter Robinson"". And 15-23 year olds praising them.

I listened to music like desert woman by zhu, Capricorn by elderbook the first time and it was incredible in shroomys . Was looking more for more mainstream artists.  Ofc there will be psytrance and hardtrance around 3 hours in, but for the introduction before they get lost in the trance I would like more familiar artists on

237,Featured Artist of the Week No. 18 - Third Party,"Hi r/edm! Welcome to the next installment of the Weekly Featured Artist Post. Our featured artist this week is Third Party!

London-based producer duo Third Party broke onto the scene during the bigroom craze of the early 2010s and have established themselves as a household name in the subgenre. Third Party‚Äôs production style is characterized by anthemic and euphoric melodies accompanied by smooth male vocalists. While their focus is on the more melodic side of bigroom, their debut album HOPE in 2017 demonstrated a breadth of production mastery within the bigroom sound ranging from the anthemic to the harder, electro house-influenced side of the genre. Third Party have collaborated with notable producers including Steve Angello and Martin Garrix and with a slew of single releases in 2018, look to continue their momentum into 2019 and beyond. Check out their music below:

Unfortunately I once again came to the conclusion that it isn‚Äôt bad music but just not my preference. After that I went back to Void and other RL songs released around that era to compare them and found no comparison jamming out to that dark energy/vibe RL Grime embodied like no other. 

I understand that he had to go in a new direction especially given his mental difficulties (anxiety/depression/etc) and that Nova helped him achieve that mental liberation to some extent. With that being said I‚Äôm craving more of that dirty trap style that RL used to produce.

Having said this does anybody have any suggestions of artists that embody that vibe RL used to masterfully construct? While different on some fronts there were artists with comparable music (old Floss comes to the forefront of that list). Unfortunately it feels like this whole genre went from being ready to explode to an afterthought with artists like RL, Floss, Yellow Claw, etc going in new directions. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! ",EDM,1542109509,mojo937,2,1,True,2018-11-13

#New EDM Playlist Update
____________
Going forward, the New EDM This Week will be changing.  The current playlist that you all are following now, will NOT be the same. That playlist is being condensed to 100ish songs, and will be more focused on the more ""popular"" artist. This is the playlist that is on the EDM Sauce account, and that is the direction they want going forward. So, I have created another account/playlist to keep doing the normal New EDM This Week playlist with ALL the tracks from this week. I will continue to update them both normally this Friday, but NEXT Friday, the playlist format is changing. Below are the links to both.

35,Should I go to Seven Lions @ RR tonight?,"As the title suggests, I bought 4 tickets awhile back to the Seven Lions show tonight at Red Rocks.

Obviously RR is an amazing experience, but it's a Thursday night, it's going to be cold, and I'm an old man (OK, 31, but I feel like an old man if that makes sense).

I originally bought the tickets because I'm a huge Anjuna fan, and I was really hoping for a Jason Ross B2B Seven Lions.  I am NOT a fan of dubstep.  I don't mind a little dub in a track as log as there's plenty of melody as well.  Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE the Jason Ross / Seven Lions collabs (Higher Love, Ocean, etc).  I seriously can't get enough of that sound, hence buying the tickets and hoping for the Jason/Ross B2B.

I've seen Jason Ross several times (absolutely amazing), and if I can't unload these tickets at a fair price (everyone seems to have them and want to get rid of them for under face, ugh) I may just go to see Jason.  

I've seen Seven Lions before at an Anjuna show (last fall's A&amp;B show), and I enjoyed it mostly.  It was about 50/50 melodic Anjuna-type stuff and harder stuff.  I even enjoyed the harder stuff (it's hard not to enjoy ANY kind of music with the **right** kind of chemical help), but the people I was with told me later he put them in a bad headspace (I think partly they had some of the **wrong** chemical help).

That being said, I have never heard the other two acts: Kill the Noise and MitiS.  I'm listening to them on Spotify now.  MitiS seems to be a lot softer -- Tritonal-like maybe?  KTN seems to be a lot like Seven Lions, with a good mix of melody, dub, and then combining them to finish the track, but as I get further into his discography I'm hearing more of the screaming and ""non-uplifting bass"" that completely turns me off.  But of course artists are often a lot different live than their popular tracks on Spotify.

Any thoughts?

**TL;DR** Huge Jason Ross/Anjuna fan.  Saw Seven Lions perform (at an Anjuna show) before, and mostly enjoyed it.  Never heard MitiS or Kill The Noise.  Cold, mid-week night, old man.  Should I go?",EDM,1539269981,bacontrees,22,1,True,2018-10-11
47,"Its me again, I need some more recommendations.","So I recently posted here trying to learn more about what exactly I like in edm and what artists I should listen to. I was give many recommendations for artists of varying genres and after listening to them all I have widdled down what it is I like.

It seems I like a genre whose exact name I can't really find. Most seem to call it melodic dubstep/chillstep? Basically I like the sound of Seven Lions. Artists like Mitis and Illenium seem to be following in the same vein as Seven Lions. What other artists have those kinds of emotional drops? Also, what exactly is the name of this subgenre?

Seven Lions - Rush over me

67,My experience with doing MDMA and now going to shows sober,"
For the first year and a half of going to EDM shows I always went sober, no alcohol, no drugs and always had an incredible time. I even did a whole 5 day festival sober and it was the best week of my life. After a year and a half of doing shows sober I was offered some MDMA by a friend when seeing Third Party, I thought screw it why not and I had one of the best nights of my life, it was an incredible experience. 

For me it was always going to be a one off taking substances since I do have health problems that I am dealing with and need to be managed, so I thought I can just go back to doing shows sober no problem. Went to see Tchami a few weeks later sober, I didn't enjoy it, went to see Armin Van Buuren after that, I didn't enjoy it. Went to see Don Diablo a few weeks later, didn't enjoy that either. All the Euphoria I used to feel when I was sober, since doing MDMA I didn't feel it anymore at shows. It's not because I don't love the music because I do, have a brief look at my post history and you'll see how much I love EDM. I have appreciation for the music but when that drop comes I just don't feel any euphoria or anything. It must be something biological or something because I spoke to my friend about it and since doing MDMA he's the same. 

It's sad that I've become one of these people who needs to be fucked up at shows to have a good time but the sad reality is that it's true. I don't tend to do many shows now days anyway but I do miss the days when I would just rock up to a show sober and have an unreal time.

196,Deadmau5 Autism Comments Discussion.,"Disclaimer: Please let this be a civil discussion. I don‚Äôt want people to start throwing around insults and putting each other down for their views. I think that Reddit can pretend that they are a civil knight with situations like these but let‚Äôs just discuss exactly what makes us upset about the situation and how it was handled and not how you feel about comments like these.

I want to start this post by explaining what exactly has been going on so those of you who aren‚Äôt on Twitter can follow this discussion and participate if you want to. A few days ago, Deadmau5 did a twitch stream in which a song by Slushii began to play. Deadmau5 called the song ‚ÄúAIDS music‚Äù and ‚Äúautistic.‚Äù Slushii then posted the clip on Twitter and said that he was on the autism spectrum and that it was offensive that Deadmau5 would bully him for it. Marshmello and a few other DJs chimed in and showed their support for Slushii and their disdain for Deadmau5‚Äôs comments that they claim came from his insecurity. Deadmau5 has since posted an apology for his comments and said he will take a break from Twitter to receive help for his mental health.

If you would like to read more about this situation and see the tweets, [this article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.billboard.com/amp/articles/news/dance/8479482/deadmau5-apologizes-offensive-comments-tweets) explains it more in depth.

Now, I want to give my view about the situation to start the discussion. Anyone that follows Deadmau5 knows he has been saying things like this that are seen as not politically correct all the time. I watched the video and read all the tweets as they came out. I think that he was simply using the word ‚Äúautistic‚Äù as an adjective in place of word ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúannoying.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think he needs to seek out help for it nor do I really believe he even is. It‚Äôs exactly like, if I think a show is dumb, I would call it retarded.

In a world that is becoming more and more sensitive to small think like this, it‚Äôs super easy to be taken out of context, especially on a live stream that isn‚Äôt edited or filtered.  If the show ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Always Sunny in Philadelphia‚Äù made this exact same joke, no one would have even batted an eye.

Obviously, my views about the situation are pretty strongly on Deadmau5‚Äôs side and I‚Äôm sure that there are plenty of people that strongly lean the other way. So, downvote me if you disagree, as Reddit typically does. But, if you do disagree, please leave a comment and tell me why.

TL;DR: Deadmau5 wasn‚Äôt making fun of Slushii‚Äôs autism and was simply using the word as an adjective to describe a song.

Some of you might know, there was a collaboration with Afrojack and G Star Raw which is a fashion brand. I was really impressed by their cloth designs which I was never interested in. I lost the official chance to buy their products, so I have been digging and digging for years in ebay and secondhand market for any leftovers. 

So I want to know if there is or was any other DJ and fashion brand collaboration. I do like buying from DJ‚Äôs merchandise shop, however I would like to know besides that. 

Thanks for reading this.

462,Featured Artist of the Week No. 14 - Wax Motif,"Hi r/edm! Welcome to the next installment of the Weekly Featured Artist Post. Our featured artist this week is Wax Motif!

Australian producer Wax Motif is a major player in pushing the g-house sound. His tracks fuse hip hop sounds with House music that is as at home at swanky upscale lounges as it is in grimy, sweaty clubs. Many producers in the Bass house and g-house scenes look to Wax Motif as an influencer, and it‚Äôs easy to see why. His portfolio of work has been released on some of the most prestigious labels in the business, including Mad Decent, Confession, Fool‚Äôs Gold, OWSLA, and Night Bass. To add to that, Wax Motif has released official releases for Major Lazer, Deadmau5, Chromeo, and Warren G, and collaborated with Destructo, GTA, Anna Lunoe, and Dillon Francis, among others. Wax Motif‚Äôs music is simultaneously measured and gripping while avoiding pretension - at its core, his music is unabashedly fun. Check out Wax Motif‚Äôs music below:

In my opinion, this was the high point for mainstream/mainstage dance music. I listen to a wide variety of dance music now but big room got me into raving and I've been feeling nostalgiac for that classic big room sound.

I'm a big fan of the curated Spotify playlists such as ""Mint"", ""Dance Party"" etc but about half the songs are future bass/pop EDM--which I enjoy--but I'm looking for mainstage bangers. The closest playlist I found that resembles what I want is Hardwell's ""Hardwell on Air"" playlist on Spotify.

[**Livsey - Persia**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrh4RGtfQo8)

&amp;#x200B;

I've on-and-off listened to EDM, and can describe my taste as follows:

\- I don't enjoy super huge build-ups to a big drop (dubstep), as I find the drops a little cringeworthy (if you like it, more power to you man, just my opinion on it).

\- I don't like there to be much melodic singing, with pauses in between upbeat sections somebody sings.

\- Hardstyle is too uptempo for me, whereas standard house music where there's no constantly-high BPM is too slow.

&amp;#x200B;

An album that got me interested is RAM 25. Songs such as Valley of the Shadows and Quest interested me. It's almost like DnB I guess.

\- Beats punchy and beautifully warped, take sample between 01:05 - 01:14 for example

66,Club Set Review: MAKJ,"Hey guys, some of you may have seen me around the sub and especially on the Discord, but I am Harain and I am a huge EDM fan (obviously). The point of this post is that I go to A LOT of club shows here in Chicago, and I noticed that club sets in general are really unique and interesting because I think they really test a DJ‚Äôs skill in reading the crowd and playing accordingly. I wanted to start reviewing these club sets to help others make decisions if going to these club sets is essentially worth it. Full disclosure: I am a normie - I love Big Room, I love hard hitting kicks, Hard dance, Psy, that kind of stuff - but I dabble in a bit of everything.

 For the purpose of these reviews I will be assuming that these club sets are NOT pre recorded (even if sometimes they are, but let's give them the benefit of the doubt). I will not go over their entire tracklists but maybe some notable selections here and there. The purpose is to give a general idea of what to expect from these club sets, and if it's something you as a reader would be interested. (Especially since some of these shows will put quite a damper on your wallet, 3 Jager Bombs and a Long Island is not cheap)

I will be judging sets based on the artist's personal style, how true they are to themself, and the sets purpose relative to the audience. For instance in Chicago the 3 biggest clubs for more mainstream DJ‚Äôs are The Mid, Prysm and Soundbar. Prysm caters towards a more ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get fucked up and party in a high end club‚Äù crowd. The Mid and Soundbar I think focus a little bit more on the experience and music itself. I would argue that Soundbar caters to a more upscale crowd than The Mid, but both try to achieve similar things with their shows.

In this post I will be reviewing  MAKJ at Prysm. MAKJ I would say is a Big Room/Bounce focused producer, but does a bit of other stuff as well. 

MAKJ came on with an impressive opener proceeding the ‚Äúpre dj‚Äù. The lights went off, air horns, fog machines, cold air blasters (IDK what they're called). And his iconic ‚ÄúOh way ooh way ohh, oh way oways aii, PARTY TIL WE DIE‚Äù blasts, really creating a great mood for the rest of the set. I was a bit upset that the track I was waiting most for (huge Timmy Trumpet fan btw) dropped so early, but it makes sense. Following this, the set included quite a bit of elements, lots of Bounce, Big Room, Hip Hop, Rap, etc‚Ä¶ by all means ‚Äúnormie friendly‚Äù but I think some of his song selections (holy goof God‚Äôs Plan) alot of hardcore EDM fans would have enjoyed as well. There were some questionable transitions, IE going from rap to 150 bpm within a 10 second window, which definitely left the crowd in confusion, but the energy was still there. I think the highlight of the set was definitely the opener,  I can't stress how much the opening song and effects play into the feel of the set. I did enjoy the diversity of the set quite a bit, definitely alot for everything, (including a bit of big psy which is a personal favorite). 

.One thing, which IMO is a cardinal sin of EDM, is you never change the classics. He dropped Reload, but on the second drop changed to a wonky trap style drop and that is unacceptable IMO. Tracks like Reload, Calling, etc‚Ä¶ are so popular and so nostalgic for so many people in the crowd that I really think you have to give it to them. Aside from that MAKJ really did a great job in bringing a fun time for the Prysm crowd. I would rate his set 8/10. It accomplished pretty much exactly what I would have expected and even a little more. 

I also saw Andrew Rayel this weekend, which was honestly incredible, but I don't want to rate it until the excitement wears off. He dropped some of my favorite tracks, Great Spirit into Maurice West‚Äôs Seven Seas for instance and I fell in love. (We also high fived once I got to the front of the crowd and in front of his booth)

Anyway thanks for reading, I would really appreciate if you left a comment based on your thoughts on anything from writing style to review style, and even if its something you'd be interested in moving forward.

91,"Fest Season PSA: Remember, hyponatremia (water intoxication), is one of the most common causes of hospitalizations &amp; deaths at music festivals &amp; raves. *This can occur without any drug use* Women are most at risk. Ensure you limit fluid intake, eat salty foods, and drink electrolytes to be safe.","Just putting this out there as I've known several people hospitalized for it before and it doesn't get talked about enough...and I'm a big advocate of teaching harm reduction over abstinence. Most people think overdose or overheating is the main way people die or end up int he ER at music festivals, usually linked with drug use. 

In fact, Hyponatremia (water intoxication) is an extremely common cause of hospitalizations and death at all EDM events. And you do not have to take drugs, or even drink excessive water, to have Hyponatremia.

Many people falsely think Hyponatremia is caused by simply drinking crazy amounts of water. This is not the full story. In fact its caused by low sodium levels in the blood stream.  
The structure of your cells rely on a balance of sodium in your blood stream (also related to your blood pressure). When the sodium balance becomes too diluted, it in turn causes your cells and organs to destabilize and swell. Most dangerously, it can cause swelling in the brain &amp; organ failure. Thats Hyponatremia.

When you sweat, you lose sodium as well as water (hence your sweat is salty). When you're dancing for many hours straight  at an event you obviously sweat a lot. When you replace that fluid loss with only water, you can easily over dilute that sodium balance..and end up in the ER or dead. 

This is also a problem very common in athletes, and one of the main reasons Gatorade/electrolyte drinks are recommended for rehydration during endurance sports. Electrolytes are pretty much a fancy name for sodium.

Obviously when you're under the influence, you can much more easily lose track of water intake, and tend to overcompensate to combat overheating. However, even people who don't take any drugs and just dance all day while drinking water all day are at risk.

For the same reason, hyponatremia can also be caused if you don't drink that much water at all. Simply sweating a lot without replacing electrolytes can have the same effects.

Women are especially susceptible to hyponetremia induced by drug use. Not only do women metabolize MDMA differently than men (studies have found effects to be amplified in women), one of the side effects of MDMA in women is excess secretion of a hormone which causes water retention.  

The best way to stay safe is to both always limit fluid intake to reasonable levels. Don't chug...sip throughout the day. Also ensure you incorporate electrolytes throughout the day. If you can't buy Gatorade or similar at the event, salty foods (chips, pretzels, etc) are also helpful. 

I highly recommend bringing packets of electrolytes like Pedialyte, Propel, or any of the many other brands to mix with water. Not only is it delicious, it will make you feel way less dehydrated on top of preventing full blown Hyponatremia.",EDM,1534132684,inthedarkend,5,12,True,2018-08-12

119,Seven Lions or San Holo,"So I recently bought tickets to Seven Lions tour and was super pumped he was coming to my city! Then San Holo also dropped a tour and is coming 2 days later. Thursday vs Saturday.

I like both artists, but tbh I'm not *that* into edm and going to both that close together would be overkill. I've seen seven lions once before but it was before he got bigger. Seeing him this time around the production will be immensely better and he has a lot more experience live/recordings under his belt. I've never seen San holo.

I tend to like seven lions more overall, but San Holo also being on Saturday and me not having to work the next day is enticing. I'd have fun at either way tho I'm sure.

Just curious if any one has seen both recently and can vouch for who puts on a better show? Thanks!",EDM,1534164511,sircaseyjames,55,19,True,2018-08-13

Phuture Noize, formerly a duo act, is a talented hardstyle producer from the Netherlands. With several album releases under his belt, most recently Black Mirror Society (2018), Phuture Noize has made waves in the hard dance scene with his penchant for story-oriented album structure, epic atmospheres, and tremendous melodies.

128,Post Moonrise Discussion,"Okay firstly I‚Äôm glad it wasn‚Äôt completely shut down and I thought they handled the inclement weather situation better than last year, day 2 was chilling because they let us go back to the parking and we tailgated until they let us back in so props to that. Parking wise, we did lot 1 posted up a flag (bucs flag) and all our friends who ubered or parked in other lots found us and we tailgated pretty hard, and detoxed in the lot after each day which was super convenient and close to the entrance line, Day 1 lines surprisingly quick, day 2 little longer but no problems, security from my experience was pretty lax, I know they had dogs at the one enterance which I know did snag some my friends stuff but they just made him throw it away and then let him in. The grounds were to me felt the same as last year I did like the switch of stellar and lunar, but I felt stellar wasn‚Äôt as loud. There wasn‚Äôt too much mud which I felt was because Moonrise did a good job prepping the grounds. Aside from cutting sets they did a good job I think trying to fit everyone best they could in despite shorten sets which was nice because I got to see almost most everyone I wanted to see. The crowd from my experience was great, no fuck boys or people generally being annoying, everyone respecting others space. Now for my favorite sets:  

1. Timmy Trumpet, despite being mad tired and the closing set of day 2 after some heavy hitters before him in the tent I think Timmy brought great energy and the fact that most probably like 90% of attendees were at Mello or X there was stupid amount of room to grove but still be basically on the rail.  

2. Griz, if you were there you know.   

3. Zeds Dead, I‚Äôve seen them 5 times now played a generic set almost matching their past few ones especially there b2b with Jauz, still a filthy fucking set that proves they are at the top of their game.   Honorary Mentions: 3LAU his festival set wayyyyyy better than his ultra violet tour set, GWK threw the fuck down, and Luca Lush brought the Heat day 1 right when we got in   Acts I wish I could‚Äôve saw: Ekali and Eptic   Acts that I felt did not live to the hype: Diplo and Kaskade but maybe it was because they only played 30min each",EDM,1534170833,ic0sahedron,12,13,True,2018-08-13

143,Food for thought On Bassnectars Political outburst,"After the whole ""Conservatives must be doing mental gymnastics if they're Bassnectar fans""... First of all, I am a conservative and I'm a Bassnectar fan. Second of all, I don't struggle with any mental gymnastics because I have learned to RESPECT other people's opinions, Lo's as well. I CAN agree to disagree... and just because i'm a conservative does not mean I am racist, homophobic, a bigot, etc etc! I respect your views, please respect mine. #plur Lo can do his thing, I'll do mine, and we can meet in the middle where the music is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have been an active member of the EDM community for 3 years because I love the foundation upon which it is built. Our motto is PLUR, Peace/love/unity/respect. It is a community and family of music lovers from all walks of life. I have always found this community to be incredibly accepting of all people and a great place to find yourself, until yesterday.

Bassnectar, decided to post on his twitter about the importance to get out and vote because ""Jesus hates Republicans"". When someone tweeted back, ""Yoooo Jesus doesn't hate anyone"" Bassnectar's responds..

""No, he just told me. He hates republicans and fake ass white trash christians who are racist and who vote for trump and try and attack immigrants and spread bullshit conspiracy theories. He legit just said it to me ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt fuckin stand republicans‚Äù literally"".

This is incredibly disappointing and hurtful not only as a conservative, Christian, AND Bassnectar fan. Yeah, he usually goes on a 5-10 minute rant about politics in his sets, which I have sat by and let him do his thing without saying a word. But now, I am being excluded and attacked because of my views? Hundreds of liberals up in arms on the internet attacking the group of people with my same views, calling us disgusting names and treating us like we're the scum of the Earth.

You're a hypocrite, Bassnectar.

What happened to America? If I spoke to liberals like this, they would freak out. I'm not allowed to have my opinion if it differs than yours? I THOUGHT this was a community of acceptance, love, and unity. Not, you're a vile cockroach if you disagree with me. I'm just appalled over what this has come to. I will continue to be tolerant of the left, even though they don't repay me the same favor.

191,"Street Parade - Zurich, Switzerland","I don't really know how to start this, but please upvote for visibility even if you do not read all of it. I was at Street Parade on Saturday and was sitting on the Quaibrucke (bridge) enjoying the music, perfect weather, and great vibes when a man approached me. He asked if anyone was sitting on the wall next to me, and when I replied no, he jumped up and sat next to me. We talked about how awesome the festival was and I introduced him to my brother, who happened to have the same name as him. He spoke only broken English, but we were all soaking in the vibes and having an awesome time. The rest happened so fast and has been replaying in my mind over and over since. Suddenly, I feel a hand grab my chest and almost push me backwards over the wall. As I turn to see what was happening, the guy that I had just met is falling, in slow motion, off of the top of the bridge, head first to the concrete \~20 feet below. As soon as he hit the ground a number of people ran over and eventually a medical boat came to get him. He appeared to be severely injured. His name is David and he is from Basel. Has anyone heard if he is okay or what condition he is in? Any update would be really helpful. Most of the articles on the festival are in German and I have not been able to find anything. 

It was an extremely sobering experience and completely changed the rest of the festival for me. Instantly I was struck with pain and overwhelming sadness. As time passed all I could (can) think about is how fast life can change. From having the best time of your life to potentially fighting for it in the blink of an eye. I really hope that David is okay, but even if you are unsure of his condition, I am asking you send some positive energy his way. I am having a hard time putting it into words, but from this experience I realized that we are all connected. I vividly felt his pain and situation, but even though there was nothing physical I could do help him, I could still hope for him and hope that he would be okay through that same channel I was feeling hurt and sorrow. Like I said, I am having a hard time putting this experience into words. Please upvote this even if you are unsure of his condition. 

TLDR: Shortly after meeting a guy at Street Parade he fell off of a wall appeared to be severely injured. I have been unable to find any updates on his condition. Stay safe. One love. ",EDM,1534215332,hockey_homie,4,5,True,2018-08-13

194,[STORY] How Moonrise Festival was the first time I ever felt true happiness in my life. Something I've been searching for 22 years.,"So, I am a festival veteran I've been to over 20 different festivals. All over the world but Moonrise 2018 will forever go down as my favorite 2 days of my life to this date. Now this is. brief story of happiness, sadness, angry, confusion, but most of all love.¬†

I like most festival goers take my fair share of treats to make my weekend as magical as possible and I am no stranger to the intense euphoria that comes with doing so. But this year was much different. I have in the past went with girlfriends, girls I was into, and just general friends of mine that I ended up just vibing with and have a good festival with but nothing like I experienced this year with someone else. I found the girl you only see in music videos and movies. This festival I went at the very last second and bought my ticket the Thursday right before the weekend and only went down with a handful of friends. In doing so I was just hoping for fun last weekend before the summer ends and was just looking forward to a standard festival going experience but boy oh boy was I wrong.¬†

Day 1 I was at Ookay live set with my friends when the festival was shut down for a little bit. Somehow in everyone leaving the festival I lost my entire group. Rookie move on my end didn't charge my phone well so I had under 20% battery at this time and I wanted to save my battery Justin cashew got let back in or if I needed to call an uber or what not but I found out quickly that trying to call anyone or text just wasn't going to happen so I just shut off my phone to save the battery. I made my way to the grandstands and I sat all by myself on this red bench type thing. After about 15 minutes or so (I'm guessing that‚Äôs how long it was because by this point in they the drugs had completely stripped my time management skills lol) I just hear a girl‚Äôs voice say ""Sitting alone?"" and I look to my left and I see this girl. Wearing a completely orange one-piece lace strapped suit of sorts greeting me with the most beautiful smile I've ever seen in my life. The only thing I could say at that point was, well, nothing. She looked at me and stepped closer and asked again ""Sitting alone"" and I finally check back into reality and say how I lost my friends walking out blah blah blah and she apparently had the same exact thing happen to her so she comes down and sits next to me. Now at this point I just thought she was just another one of the many very friendly and beautiful girls at the festival and kind of just needed someone to chill with until we saw our friends walk by or we were let back into the festival. We hit it off like crazy, she tells me her name is Logan and we start just hitting it of like I said and just really were on the same vibes and it was awesome but next thing you know people were rushing back into the grounds and we split up never to be seen again. I wondered around by myself trying to find my friends and still couldn't find them so at this point I pretty much excepted the fact I was going to be going solo for the rest of the day so I bounced my way back in forth from stage to stage seeing as much as I could. I find myself at Zeds Dead at the Steeler stage and I walk into the crowd a bit right in front of the sound tent and about 5-6 drops, I'm Viking having a great time, to the moon candy flipping and I just turn around and take it all in and just a little bit behind me to left wouldn't you know it there‚Äôs the girl. All by herself. Vibing. Dancing having the time of her life and I just remember looking at her and not really believing it. I kept losing sight in between people dancing so I just turned around and then started going back to having fun by myself but I kept turning and looking every couple of seconds and all of a sudden, a group 3 girls tab me on the shoulder and all basically at the same time yell ""go over there and get her!!"" I laughed and said fuck it and did. I walked over, we caught eyes and she just smiled and came close to me, kissed me, and said into my ear ""I had a feeling we'd find each other"" and I don't think we said another full sentence to each other the rest of the night. we stayed at Stellar the rest of the night for the end of Zeds dead and DJ Snake, vibing, dancing, making out here and there and just enjoying each other. Everything is obviously going amazing but the sets fly by and next thing I know it‚Äôs all over. Our time is over. We start walking to the exit she's holding my hand and then tugs it for me to stop, I turn around she gives me one last kiss and all she says is ""you made me so happy"" and runs off before I can say anything into the crowd. I was stunned and just like what the fuck is happening to me right now what the hell is going on my mind is racing I'm lost stunned in confusion. After a 70$ Uber to my Airbnb I somehow go to bed pretty quick and didn't really have much of just happened on my mind.

I wake up the second day and recap my day with my friends but since my phone was turned off I didn't have any pictures or videos of my day and I didn't even have a chance to get the girls number or anything so that bummed me out when I finally realized that sober but I at this point mainly just hoped to not get separated again and have a nice last day of the festival with my friends. We pregame and everything, get through security, and are all set to go and most of SNBRN but then again, the weather delayed the festival obviously. My group managed to stick together this time when we left the grounds during the weather delay and everything was ok. We sit in the stands and get really friendly with a group of girls that were all super cool and end up walking into the festival with them when they let everyone back in. I somehow manage to get separated again but I found my group outside the bathrooms near stellar. The girls we were with wanted to get food and some drinks so it took us awhile to get our bearing straight but this entire time I just keep looking around hoping I see this girl again. Secretly just hoping I would run into her and pick up right where we left off but it started becoming more and more clear it wasn't going to happen. Now I've been to enough festivals that I knew that me running into this girl once without any totem to work off of, any special piece of clothing, without a number, snapchat, anything was just really not going to happen. It actually killed my vibe when I started realizing this for the first time that day which never really ever happens to me but I quickly recovered and had a best jumping around to different sets.

So, I'm with my group and we make sure we get a great spot for Galantis. we make our way did center and oddly enough kind of right infant of the sound tent like I ended up the night before on stellar stage but this time it was lunar. Now an important note to make here is that this entire time I remembered that when I first met this girl Logan we both talked about how much we love Galantis and it was the one set we weren't going to miss for the world. So, in the back of my head I thought if there was any chance id see this girl again it would be at Galantis but I knew it wasn't going to happen in actuality. So, the set starts and I'm beyond happy I'm with my good friends I'm peaking at this point and Love On Me starts playing and I SHIT YOU NOT as soon as I hear ""girl put your love on me I feel it all round"" I get a hand on my lower back and I turn to my left and there she is!!!!!!! Wearing an all-white strapped outfit similar to the one the day before and looked AMAZING. We hugged and all she said in my ear was ""Make memories with me ok?"" I shook my head yes and said ""now you're the one making me happy"" and she kissed me and we had the best set of my life. We walked to marshmallow holding hands and dancing the entire way there just to any little piece music we could here, stopped to kiss and talked a little bit more and right as we got up to stellar we stopped and she hugged me for like legitimately 30 seconds and didn't even say word and then we just ran into the ground not even looking back. For anyone. We got all the way to the front left of the stage and just danced the night away and enjoyed each other and couldn't keep pour hands of each other and just couldn't stop smiling. I swear I was in a movie or something. It was insane I had never felt that level of happiness and connection with someone in my life. Mellos set was incredible and couldn't have went by quicker for us. We again started are walk back and I looked at her and I asked her"" you're not going to run off on me, again are you?"" and she just smiled and said ""I think that would make things easier right?"" and all I could think of to say was ""make what easier"" and she just smiled again and said ""the idea of our time together. we are in love with it and I don't ever want to let that feeling go but if we just leave then there‚Äôs always that what if"" and I like kind of got stunned by it and just didn't know how to reply and I said ""well will you at least tell me your last name!"" and she kissed me and winked and then just walked away.¬†

I didn't chase her. I didn't want to. I knew nothing more was going to come out of it nor did I want anything more. To some that might sound lame but for me I was just so happy, and angry that it had to end, and excited about what just happened to me, confused on how I felt about it all, but most of all love. Love for Moonrise, Love for the people there, Love for the music, Love for the EDM culture, and most of all this Love I seemed to have for Logan. I had the second day, a fully charged phone but that was the thing the entire day I was taking photos and videos but when I was with her I just stayed in the moment and didn't think about living the moment through my phone I was just worried about her and she was only worried about me. Neither of us touched our phones the entire time and we just lived in the moment. Now since my mind has been running at a million miles per hour since all of this I had gotten to think about it all and I think what she said was right. We were in love with the IDEA of each other. We were in love with the IDEA of what our time was like and to think it could last forever. Now I'm not saying true love like that doesn't exist out there but to imagine that our level of euphorbia and connection for each other would have been maintained to the same degree it was the last two nights is just crazy. I love this girl. I love my time with her. I love everything bout actually every minute I had with her. But what made this weekend the best festival for me was the fact that I finally had reached a level of happiness and genuine love, even for a short time, with someone else and it has been something I've been seeking almost my entire life. I would love to know who this girl is. I would to see her again. But all I have is her name Logan, and that she is from New York City. I'm not going to try and somehow be weird and find her on social media with that little amount of information because I feel like it would be weird and it would spoil the way I remember her. But hey Logan if you are somehow reading this or someone is somehow showing you this. Just know we did make memories and you made me so happy.¬†

Logan I‚Äôll be secretly looking for at all my future festivals but hey because of you I‚Äôll be back every year for moonrise just in case I can have one more set with you :). Sorry for the long story I just wrote this entire thing in one go the grammar and everything is probably awful but I needed to vent and get all of this off my chest.¬†",EDM,1534216161,Spacecut,27,114,True,2018-08-13

337,REZZ Overrated Discussion,"TL:DR Someone started a discussion in the Shambhala Facebook group saying Rezz is highly overrated, some agreed some of her fans brigaded, Rezz chimed in on the thread and commented on Twitter about it.

https://www.facebook.com/groups/ShambhalaMusicFestivalBC/permalink/10156182011488110/?comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22O%22%7D

I think it's interesting that Rezz commented, I think musicians in general it can be a tough go especially when critics come out. For her the quick rise to popularity it may be a bit harder to take having a bunch of people suddenly not feeling your stuff.

I like some of her music, think it sounds good on good sound system etc, but think her DJing is nonexistent (so no she doesn't ""slay"" live like people say), her production seems to be repetitive, and her fan base is so spun up into this weird cultish frenzy I think it makes probably just makes her an easier target (they act like Bieber/Gomez fans on Twitter.)

Just wondering if other have any thought on Rezz being overrated and/or this little bit of drama going on.

I placed the order on June 20th and after about two weeks of no update on anything regarding my order, I sent an email asking what was going on. They sent me some automated response and so I asked for a response from a real person. 

They said my order got lost and they'll reship me a new one. They created a new package on July 11th and it's not even on the way yet, according to the USPS tracker.

First off I wanna say thanks to everyone in the community for sharing excellent music, and for the diverse and (mostly) respectful sharing of opinions. This subreddit has allowed me to explore and learn a lot about electronic music.

My question is basically, if I love Porter Robinson's music, should I attend Virtual Self (coming to my hometown in September)?

I'd have to sell my Zhu tix to afford it. I know I'm not a huge fan of Virtual Self on Spotify, but there are many producers and DJs who crush it live, even when I don't really vibe with thier studio stuff.

What's the show like? I can't seem to find a quality recording of him live, like at Ultra or EDC.

They had all their songs chopped up so that they could play them in different modes on those panels in front of them. They also had these big futuristic looking drums behind them. When they started, they opened up going nuts on those drums to the beat of Animus Vox. They had a good flow, got the crowd involved, and really looked like they were enjoying themselves up there. They had their opener Elohim come up and sing her vocals live for a song they collaborated on. Had a sort of DJ battle to We Can Make The World Stop. They were dripping in sweat and winded by the end of it. It was honestly a beautiful set and they got a thunderous applause when they finished.

Last week 2 STEP GARAGE was voted the genre people most wanted to learn about / have as a playlist! This playlist would be very small at this point so we need all the help we can get!

This week the vote went to EURO TRANCE / HANDS UP. 

I figure a lot of you probably know these genres better than us, so I invite everyone here who listens to 2 Step or Euro Trance to come over before Sunday to recommend songs and upvote the other submissions that would best represent these specific genres to the world.

335,Can anyone help me find a specific UK DJ interview?,"Chances of this panning out are super slim, but I've got my fingers crossed...

A year or two (or maybe longer- I've got a diminished sense of time) ago I came across this awesome interview on YouTube with a well known DJ/producer from the UK who, if I recall, was really big in the 90's and early 2000's. The interviewer was also British and very knowledgable in music. It was a ""your 20 favourite records"" type thing where he'd spin some of his favourite tracks from these records and talk about the significance of each one. One of the things I recall vividly was his discussing how one of the records was of particular importance because he'd discovered it through his brother, who passed away- and the DJ got teary eyed talking about it. It was an eclectic mix of records he sampled (I think) ranging from old motown/rnb/soul to 80's house and beyond. It was quite a long interview, maybe even an hour. I literally can't remember anything else about it- can't remember any of the records/tracks or anything. I do remember they were standing the entire time and the DJ could of been kind of pudgy in stature. 

If this rings a bell to anyone and you could help me located the video, I'd be very grateful! I thought I had it saved somewhere in my vast collection of bookmarks, but after obsessively raking through them for the past two days I'm coming up dry...

345,"Documentary: ""What We Started""--all I can say, is ""Wow""","""What We Started"" is currently available for rent and/or purchase on Amazon.

I've been looking forward to this documentary since I first heard about it a few years ago. I saw that it was up for rental on Amazon for 99 cents, so I sat down and watched the documentary--and was floored.

If you're a fan of dance music, you owe it to yourself to watch this film.  The film features interviews with the likes of Richie Hawtin, Pete Tong, Seth Troxler, Afrojack, David Guetta, Pasquale Rotella, Disco Donnie, Tiesto, Steve Angello, Moby, Erick Morello, Dubfire, Paul Oakenfold, and others.

The film does a good job of highlighting the history of dance music: from disco, house, the rise of techno in Detroit, as well as the love parade and popularization of techno in Germany; the documentary chronicled the commercialization of dance music's fusion with pop--culminating with the huge boom in the ""EDM"" scene with festivals like EDC, Ultra, etc.

The dichotomy displayed between Martin Garrix and Carl Cox was well done too. Garrix spoke highly of Carl Cox and his influence on dance music as a whole, while Carl Cox commented on the commercialization and popularization of ""EDM"" and by the end of the film, had a real touching moment where he essentially, ""passed the torch"" to Martin Garrix.

As a fan of all forms of dance music, from house/techno/underground to progressive house and big room--this movie was everything I didn't know I wanted. I hope some of you will watch the film and enjoy it just as much as I did.     ",EDM,1529133293,DJAnalFilth,4,25,True,2018-06-16

79,Can we just talk about Goh?,"I have been jamming out to What So Not's new album, Not All The Beautiful Things, ever since it came out. It's an incredible album, and I thoroughly enjoy every song. I listen to many of the songs (especially Warlord, Be Ok Again, and Us) very frequently. 
However, there is one song that just frustrates me so much. 
Goh might have one of the best drops I've heard in years. It's so melodic and groovy, yet hard as hell. I really get chills hearing it. 
HOWEVER, I absolutely cannot stand the vocals in it. They almost hurt my ears. To me, they do not fit with the melody one bit. 
If the vocals were sparse, and just during the verses/bridge, that would be okay. But they literally interrupt the incredible drop, just for a small breakdown in between the different styles of the drops. It's infuriating! 
In my opinion, the drop needs to be much longer, and with no vocal breakdowns in between. 
This song has so much potential, and yet I find myself frustrated every time I listen to it. So much so that I cannot listen to it anymore. I end up just disappointed every time. 

This is just a small meaningless rant, but I was just curious to see how other people felt about it. 
I've been searching YouTube for a good remix every so often, or potentially an edited version without vocals. Maybe some day we'll get a good one. ",EDM,1526359067,Apples4lyfe2,2,2,True,2018-05-15

1)Did he just stumble on the track and just remixed it and send it to a label? 2)Or did he stumble on it, remixed it and send it to Mr.Probz? 3)Or did Probz contact Robin to remix the track?
I'm looking for vocals myself and I'm interested how it works when you aren't a big producer or popular within the scene. I can't find any info around this topic, I know he's been producing since 2007 so maybe he made some connections along the way?

Beyonce - 7/11 (Jack U Remix)

227,Ghost producing How-To?,"I've been looking into ghost producing for some time now and haven't found any real guide on how to get the exposure, who to contact, where to start.

I understand that the question is similar to 'how to become a successful producer' with common answers like build your social media, produce regularly, network etc. But besides that what specific advice could you give on getting some ghost producer deals? Randomly contacting instagram artists? Looking into some secret ghost community?

Also, how to approach so you don't get ripped of? How do I approximate the value of my track? Which rights to give - I see there are publishing vs. Masters rights? Where to find some contract template or how to build one my own?

What I've found for now is one page that actually sells quite often (atleast as they say): https://www.edmghostproducer.com/be-a-ghost/ How efficient are these pages - do they do good business for you?

At last, my main social media is Instagram where I have my audience and producer identity. Is it adviceable to publicly reveal that you offer your services? Does that somehow lower your bar down, making you target of low-life artists who would just annoy you?

Basically, any advice is appreciated but it would be useful if it's close to a concrete breakdown how-to?",EDM,1526516695,lovrom23,0,2,True,2018-05-16

Now I know there‚Äôs tons of better albums out there but you gotta remember that this is his 1st album. I‚Äôm judging this album on how it was executed. Couple months ago he released snap chats lowkey previewing all the songs and he only released 2 (maybe 3 I forget) songs prior to the album. What I love is he stay consistent through the whole album, all his tracks were similar in some ways but different. Where I think artists go wrong with albums is they try to do too much and but too many genres are EDM in them. Ookay also stayed with his sound and what he knew worked where other artists (Chainsmokers, Don Diablo, Alison Wonderland) abounded their sounds and went for a hail marry which in my option failed. It‚Äôs been a awhile since I‚Äôve been hype for an EDM album and been able to to listen to it consistently because of how good it is.

230,Good link/video/summary of what is going on with electronic music these days. Older dude wanting to catch up.,"So when I was young in Orlando we had house music in the gay clubs, then the rave things started happening which was a lot of fun (LA Style and what not) then things moved more into clubs and things started getting more divided (Miami bass, the drum and bass/jungle thing had club nights around down, ambient Orb stuff, and Rabbit in the Moon) then they kept adding more ""styles."" I started losing track around whatever gabba was.     
Then I went full hippy and left the electronic scene totally and did my drugs out in the woods instead. (mostly joking)      
The technology has changed so much and there seems to be soooo many different sub genres I am wondering:    
-what is the popular cool kid style now    
-what is the hipster ""barely know one knows about this stuff"" style    
-what is the up and coming style that seems to be the next thing.

a premium spotify account is required to use JQBX, though.

You can check out my electronic music lobby: [The Dance House](http://www.jqbx.fm/invite/room/tdh)

Or you can visit the site at https://www.jqbx.fm/ cause there are TONS of great music of all genres being played in other lobbies. You will never have a bad time, I promise.

for those worried about site/app permissions, https://www.jqbx.fm/permissions

1. must not be older than April.

3. if you post more than one, i'll pick the one i like the most. 
4. if I add your song, please share the playlist link to your socials. I can't really force you to do that, but if I add you it's in good faith that you'll hold up your part of the agreement. 
5. don't post other people's music. if you didn't write it/remix it/or manage it, dont post it lol. just your own songs, or versions of songs.

281,Consider me Datsik's #1 Fan. Looking for Advice...,"The first dubstep song I heard and loved was Datsik Nuke Em. I stopped listening to him for a while but come 2015-2018 I absolutely lived and breathed Datsik/Ephwurd. I was planning on getting a tattoo this year. I may not have it (thankfully) but there is a tattoo on my soul and I feel as if it has just been lit on fire. I have flags and plenty of merch. This may be funny to some and I am ready for the harassment for choosing my idol so poorly. But I truly thought this guy was amazing. I met him at a Joyryde show in Hollywood CA, nothing but a class act to me and my girlfriend. Only verified my love for the guy. He wasn't fucked up (yet). I even loved how he carried himself sadly. I have always hated guys that use alcohol/drugs as a weapon for their sexual conquests. The stories are just overwhelming me. I love Ephwurd and most of my favorite shows are either Datsik/Ephwurd. I just went to my first Shambhala in 2017, a festival Datsik/Excision are basically gods of. A place I consider to be the greatest place in my mind. Now I feel it will be tarnished and the talk around such an amazing place will be about this at times. I feel betrayed by someone I really didn't know on a personal level, but I feel at times, people like me, who are all or nothing type people, and who become obsessive about things they love at times, feel like they do know these people on a personal level through their music. What I am asking is, what the fuck would you do if you were me, it's not as simple as never listen to him again, burn all your shit etc. There is an emotional attachment I have to his music and I feel like shit for it. I am just looking for advice bcuz I know some people in the rave community are willing to offer some support. 

Edit: I'd also like to add that my girlfriend of nearly 6 years was a victim of sexual assault at age 13 so this is extremely crippling to me in that way as well. I may not respond to many or any comments. but I will read all of them.",EDM,1521240601,Electric_Demigod,29,59,True,2018-03-16

346,Someone please help me understand Trap music,"Let me first start by saying I appreciate all music. Whatever floats your boat. I have been into EDM for 25+ years. But there are several types of music I don't ""get"". Years past it was stuff like ""Jungle"" or ""Tribal"" that just made my ears bleed. Lately it is Trap. I have been to several festivals and it seems to be more prolific than ever before. (Jungle was mainly a stage in the corner) But I honestly don't get it. People creating a mosh pit at a EDM festival headbanging and shit? Listen, again, trying not to judge but I honestly don't get it. It sounds like just noise to me. And yes, this includes the bigger names (although not all trap) like Skrillex, Datsik, NGHTMRE, etc... Even the parts that I think I can get into, such as a nice vocal, are ruined once a ""drop"" hits and it just turns into 155 bpm noise. Even the shit I think I will like, such as illenium, just turns into noise live!

Someone honestly change my mind or find something I can explore!! Again, my roots are Trance but have expanded to house, some techno, progressive, some future, some big room, and even tropical... So I get most every out ther sound but Trap.

467,EDC vs Ultra help...,"I turn 18 next January and I‚Äôve told myself for years that my senior trip will be going to a large festival. I‚Äôve narrowed it down to either Ultra Miami and EDC LA. I did research and found that both festivals cost roughly the same price (tix, plane, hotel, food, exc). Did the math and found that they both cost round trip about 1300-1500. I live on the east coast so I‚Äôm looking for which festival i should go to in 2019 

Ultra:
Ultra would be easier to go to but honestly, my opinion of Ultra has changed over the years. I‚Äôve heard things about how Ultra isn‚Äôt as nice as it seems and they are a holes to artists and therefore some artists don‚Äôt go or are not asked to perform (Don Diablo is my favorite artist and I know everything that happend with him and Ultra). ultra also just seems to have all the mainstream artists that most of which are washed up. But overall Ultra seems like a very fun festival all together. 
EDC:
I‚Äôve heard that EDC is a pain. Between having to prep your body by being nocturnal for a couple days and on top of that I‚Äôve heard that because the festival is on a racetrack, it gets insanely hot. Now hotness dosnt really bother me too much but still. 1 major plus I‚Äôve seen from EDC LA is that they have pretty much every artist under the sun playing there. EDC has their mainstream artists but they also have mid teir artists that are equally as good. 

I have been to Moonrise festival last 2 years and going for a third this year so I do somewhat know what to expect at a festival. I really don‚Äôt want go make the wrong decision so any other insight that someone could give me would be amazing. 

- I do know about EDC Orlando but that‚Äôs held during the fall and it would be during my 1st semester of college so I wouldn‚Äôt be able to go to it.

280,My first edm concert: Louis The Child,"Hey there I'm writing this post quickly after being to Louis The Child's Europe tour. It was my first ever edm concert as nobody plays in Berlin and if someone had played some years ago, I couldn't go because of age restriction. So Whethan played for 1h and I haven't listened to his music beforehand because I didn't know he was coming too (wasn't on my ticket when I bought it) but he was amazing and has some great tracks. I will definitely listen through his Spotify page once I get home. Next up was Louis The Child and it was a blast! Every song that I was hoping to be played got played and they were barely on the mic which was a good thing. After their set Freddy hugged many girls that were in the front and I got to shook hands with him quickly. As Robby went off stage I shook hands with him too but he almost fell off the stairs but he held onto my hand so I saved you there buddy, haha!

They went backstage and many people were waiting infront of the door for them to come out, I rushed back to the dancefloor as 'Helix by Flume' got played. I saw them going next to their merch booth and had a little meet and greet with them. I thanked Robby for coming to Berlin because we don't have many edm related concerts here and told him that I love their track 'Love Is Alive' and included it in my Valentinesday Mixtape. It doesn't hold that much of a value as I'm just someone with 2k soundcloud plays but he was still very thankful. I then got a pic with both of them together. Their manager always dragged them back to their backstage room but they still wanted to give every fan a picture who asked for it which was very genuine of them! The venue still had some unknown DJs playing which was a nice ending.

So I basically payed 20‚Ç¨ for Whethan, Louis The Child, a meet and greet, a pic and basically club entrance as it was a club night after they left.

Not many cities on their tour have their venues sold out so if you have a chance to see them definitely do!",EDM,1518740083,multisofteis,7,6,True,2018-02-15

428,Underrated Artist: Meishi Smile,"Hey, I discovered Meishi Smile a couple days ago and I was bewildered to find that he was making music at such good quality with only 6,280 monthly listeners on Spotify.

His music is similar to Porter's in the sense that it's very emotional and dreamy. Quoting their website, ""MEISHI SMILE IS AN ELECTRONIC PROJECT BASED IN LOS ANGELES, CA. 

INFLUENCED BY GENRES BOTH EQUALLY POP AND EXPERIMENTAL, THE PROJECT SERVES AS A FORCE TO COLLAPSE THE BINARY BETWEEN SUCH EXTREMES, TAKING NOTE FROM THE CATHARTIC AFTERGLOW OF HARSH NOISE, THE JOYFUL IDEALISM OF JAPANESE POP AND THE HAZY, MEDITATIVE SENTIMENT OF SHOEGAZE. 

TOGETHER THESE RANGE OF INFLUENCES SET TO EXPLORE THE CONTRADICTING NATURE OF SUCH FEELINGS, PRESENTING A SENSE OF MUSICALITY THAT IS ODDLY WARM WITHIN ITS STATIC DISCONNECTION.""

My favorite song is his most recent, Always. It's such a wonderful song that made me feel very emotional listening to it. Quoting his twitter, he says, ""In 2014, I met some of the most important people in my life through Zoom Lens &amp; Maltine

We wrote a song. It took 4 years, but now we're happy with where it's at

It's about those years and it's changes, for better and for worse

There's a bunch but I'll use Don Diablos new album as an example. I don't listen to much future house but I love really good future house tracks, which he has put out many. I listened to this album expecting 10-12 amazing tracks but the were all slowed down and super mellow.

72,"Artists like Axwell Ingrosso, Zedd, Chainsmokers and Galantis should look at Martin Garrix as an example of how to make pop friendly music and not have your fan base turn on you","Garrix has had huge commercial success and charted extremely well in the last year and a half with songs like There for you, Scared to be lonely, In the name of love and So far away. But for every mainstream ""sell out"" song he's released, he's also produced songs like songs like Sun is never going down, Together, Byte, Chinatown (not released yet), Pizza and Forever. Despite the huge success of his future bass/pop songs he's continued to release some of the best Progressive songs in the EDM scene today to please his EDM fans. This is why nobody complains when Garrix does release one of his pop radio songs.This is something that the above artists that I mentioned in the title could incorporate and they might not have their whole fan base turn on them. People would be less bothered about Zedd releasing songs like Get low if for every Get low we got a Spectrum or Clarity but that's not the case. With Garrix when we get a There for you, we get Pizza and Forever. So well done Martin Garrix, for in a time when he's had huge commercial success he's still produced high quality Progressive house for us EDM fans to enjoy ",EDM,1515984706,Heatedbread,163,372,True,2018-01-14

146,Worst feeling a musician can experience?,"Just a (shower?) thought I had the other day, I think it must be one of the worst feelings for a Singer/Music producer/Band to have a remix of one of their songs be more popular than the original.
In some cases, the artist's most popular song is not even something they actually made, but instead a remix produced by another artist, usually a music producer.

Examples that come to mind:

-""Lilly Wood &amp; The Prick - Prayer in C"" vs Robin Schulz's Remix.
-""Mike Posner - I Took a Pill in Ibiza"" vs Seeb's Remix.
-""Tove Lo - Habits(Stay High)"" vs Hippie Sabotage's Remix

These examples are kind of old but I'll add more recent ones if I can remember.

I‚Äôll take Alesso as an example, he has become a shadow of his former self. 2012-2015sh Alesso was one to reckon with and to me this was perfection. Anything hr touched then was gold. 
I‚Äôm a still a fan of Alesso but I‚Äôm finding it hard to stay connected with his current style. 
In last week‚Äôs episode of Protocol Radio by Nicky Romero he brought this topic up. He said ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt move too far from your roots because people like your music for a reason‚Äù  which I completely agree with. 
Although many artist say that a change can bring about a new fan base and open new doors, at the same time its drops some of your hardcore fan base that placed you on the level you currently are.  An artist can also change making you fall in love with his/her music even more.  But IMO I feel like most of them are in hunt of that global nomination to a certain award show or chart.

Since we are nearing the end of the calendar year, I'm curious to hear what your favorite performances were. Beyond just the music, there is so much that makes a show special for someone - the venue, the lights/screens, the emotional connections - I just want to hear about your personal favorites 

For me it goes:

3) Gryffin - The Blind Pig, Ann Arbor:
This was honestly an amazing set. Between the drums and guitar Gryffin was sick. Small, intimate venue, ton of fun

2) Porter Robinson - Lollapalooza, Chicago:
Rain was falling, set was actually cut short, but this was my first real introduction to Porter's music, and it was incredible 

1) Martin Garrix - Ushuaia Beach Hotel, Ibiza:
Everything came together perfectly and I was able to see Garrix while overseas. Great set, and the whole setup at Ushuaia is perfect, Can't wait to go back

465,I'd just like to personally say thanks to Nick/Illenium,"Hi there. I recently lost one of my friends much too soon. A close friend of mine passed away about a month ago, and it's made these cold, dark winter months tougher than ever. We did lots of things together and enjoyed going places we shouldn't have been together. I remember the hours before Awake was released, him and I were in some old junkyard, and I wanted to leave a little early to go listen to the album at 12:01am, lol. Either way, I'm a photographer and liked taking pictures of the stars, and he liked breaking in to things under the cover of darkness - so naturally, we were pretty good friends. I took some of my favorite pictures of all time with him nearby. Recently in a sort of ode to him, I went back to a bunch of places we (may or may not have) trespassed together and took these pictures:

https://photos.app.goo.gl/SI2I5iAsoNcFsZ1c2

Those lyrics from Beautiful Creatures have been hitting me hard, and accurately represent how I've been feeling these last few weeks.

I would just like to say, Nick, your music has been making me cry lately, which is unlike me - but at the same time, it continuously brings back a flood of good memories I had with my friend, so I'd just like to personally thank you for that. You may have seen me at your Buffalo show, I was front row, your left, I was the one with the really weird blonde afro thing on my head (aka: my hair), you killed it, and you sure as hell better keep it up.

Thanks for reading everyone and just listening to me vent. 

Just remember if you're every having a tough time with life, just think to yourself, ""now here I am, just happy to be alive.""

[RealMind](https://soundcloud.com/realmindmusic) ‚Äì member of Billboard‚Äôs Le Chau collective group

[GetYourSnackOn](https://soundcloud.com/getyoursnackon) ‚Äì friend of Grey, has worked on some MAJOR projects but this account is jaw-dropping remakes of other producers

[Defibrillator](https://soundcloud.com/defibrillatormusic) ‚Äì Deadmau5 wannabe, had many solid old tracks that he deleted, now does more experimental stuff

86,Was disappointed by EDC Orlando. Are all festivals like this?,"I have 2 major disappointments.

1. I felt like nobody was really dancing. I wanted to go crazy and get lost in a huge crowd of people going crazy and dancing their ass off. But most people were just kind of bobbing along to the music or lightly moving. It wasn't until a drop that people would go crazy and then go back to just sort of swaying. The only people I saw actually dancing, were the people who were actually good at dancing...and those people were usually on the outer edges of the crowd or way in the back. I can't dance with them, I can't dance at all. I thought this would be remedied by going to the Neon Garden where its all house and trance music, but even there people barely danced. I would try to look around for a group of people dancing so I could push past to them...but couldn't really find much.

2. I wanted to hear the songs that I knew by the artists I went to see. But I was so disappointed. I feel like every DJ played the same songs over and over again. I got so tired of hearing Wonderwall, Vengaboys, Sandstorm, Mask Off, Humble, Purple Lamborghini, Living on a Prayer, Better Off Alone, Still Dre, and Antidote over and over again in every fucking set. I'd be like ""OH SHIT I LOVE THIS SONG"" and they'd play their own song for 30 seconds and then dududududududududu and i think to myself  ""my fucking god ive heard this song 3 fucking times today.""",EDM,1510806313,Tirriforma,35,7,True,2017-11-15

3,Any good rock songs from rock artists older than 45?,"I have a firm belief that great rock is created between the ages of 20-45 and that great rock artists, no matter how great they are fall off a cliff in terms of creative output in their later years.

I have found two exceptions to this rule.

The song titled ""Nothing"" by Robert Plant / Allison Krauss and the song titled ""Paradise"" by Bruce Springsteen.  Plant was in his 60's when Nothing released.  Springsteen in his 50's

I think they're undeniably rock and they fit coming from an aging artist.  Somehow less impactful if they came from a younger artist.

They say that Jim Morrison's dad was a navy guy who started the Vietnam war.

I remember an album cover with a 14 yo naked girl holding a silver model airplane near her naked bosom, I can't remember the name of the band.

Are we going to let pedophilia ruin rock 'n roll?

Jimmy Page was a huge Aleister Crowley fanboy.

Elton John was caught with child porn 'art', which is CP for the rich.

Elton is accused by a famous child rape Aussie whistleblower.

I think something cultural is going on.

I don't care about political implications.

56,[Discussion] Guitar smashing and instrument destruction,"This is sort of a poll, I guess. 

I always thought everyone just kinda went crazy for instrument destruction during a show, until I saw all these comments on YouTube videos for bands like The Dillinger Escape Plan, even Deep Purple, Jimi Hendrix, The Who, and Nirvana, all legends that all of a sudden people are trashing and calling ‚Äúoverrated and terrible‚Äù just because they destroyed and object. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so disrespectful, give it to me‚Äù all that whiny BS. 

I vote badass. I understand why some don‚Äôt like it, but that‚Äôs a part of the point. And overall, people love it precisely because it‚Äôs disrespectful and brutal. It‚Äôs fun to riot and come on, who doesn‚Äôt like to destroy shit, or watch shit get destroyed? That‚Äôs why most people like it. It satisfies an aggressive desire for sadism in a typically high adrenaline/high testosterone environment. A random and epic outburst of violence. 

I think it‚Äôs a bit different today - I can‚Äôt imagine artists like Jimi Hendrix or Pete Townsend smashing instruments if they came about today, it‚Äôs floated up the genre ladder as rock gradually produced more aggressive genres. I would expect to see a guitar smashed in a fit of adrenaline at a hardcore show, maybe not a blues or a folk rock show, for example...though it‚Äôs all over the place. 

Off the top of my head, The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Nirvana, Kiss, Metallica, Saxon, Yngwie Malmsteen, The Yardbirds, Skid Row, Nine Inch Nails, Deep Purple, Krokus, Warbeast, Dillinger Escape Plan, The Clash, The Misfits, ad infinitum, made a habit of doing this. They‚Äôre still awesome musicians anyways, and anyone trashing them because they destroy their own property for entertainment is being a pussy killjoy, imo.

But I can‚Äôt stand people that whine and say it‚Äôs ‚Äúclich√©‚Äù. Um, yeah, that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs as old as the guitar solo...showmanship, specifically instrument destruction, began in ‚Äò63 with The Who (though with a few smaller, isolated acts before then) - that‚Äôs going on 60 years, more than half a century, of instrument destruction being an oft practiced staple across the rock music scene and its many, many sub-genres. Millions of bands across the word, small local ones and big, arena-selling ones have done it. It‚Äôs badass. It‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs not supposed to be some artsy expression that ‚Äúwas only acceptable when Jimi did it‚Äù - it‚Äôs fun to destroy shit. Its badass and it always will be.

The new Idles album stacks up with even the best of Dead Kennedys. The new Daughters album goes head to head with the best of Ministry. The whole entire metal scene is amazing atm especially considering that once bands like Warrant were the face of the genre. Yeah it's not the most popular genre but that doesn't change the quality of it. If you think a genre is dead because it's not popular anymore then your taste in music is probably dead. Even old bands you might like, like Judas Priest and Nine Inch Nails are making some amazing work. Get over yourselves and listen to new music.

110,[Story] My band smashed all of our instruments at the end of our last show together. It felt amazing.,"This is sort of a fluff post but I just had to share this, haha. My band plays mathcore and hardcore punk, and we all really love Dillinger Escape Plan, so we decided to throw a show worthy of them. We went out with 43% Burnt. 

Something comes over me whenever I play DEP, especially that song, man. We were playing this packed basement show in my hometown in Indiana and the energy was insane. We were going on break for a bit after this last show together, so we decided to tear shit up.

I had a fairly nice Strat that‚Äôs fucking kindling now and I don‚Äôt event give a fuck, it felt so damn good to beat the crap out of that thing. Started playing that insane outro, and all of a sudden our drummer starts stabbing his drum heads and toppling his kit, so I just rip all of my strings off with unmatched fury, raise that thing above my head, and just slam it down like a mad man 10+ times, till the thing is completely shattered...it looks like wood chips. Then I used the mutilated neck to stab the kick drum and my amps. Our bassist actually laid his P-bass down on the concrete, and smashed it with one of his replacement basses. A group of guys from the crowd ended up tossing the amps everywhere and stomping the shit out of them/ripping them apart. It was epic. 

We threw a lot of the broken wood and bits of instrument and burned them in a bonfire in the backyard. It was an insane night. I don‚Äôt regret a thing. Everyone was screaming and cheering, and before I knew it, I was brutalizing my Strat. It felt so good to kill that guitar via blunt force.

I heard he also listened to Gregorian monk chants and childrens music - maybe he got some melodies from these songs? I know Krist Novoselic lived in Croatia and influenced him with Hrast- Parni Valjak (Riff) for Nirvana- About A Girl. 

*Update: 
Daggerman- That Girl (riff) was used for for Nirvana- Smells Like Teen Spirit

Eleventh Dream Day- Tenth Leaving Train (riff) was used for for Nirvana- On A Plain

I made the following discoveries and added them to the list: God's Acre- Wood (guitar riff) influenced Nirvana- Rape Me, Butthole Surfer - Bar-B-Q Pope (guitar riff starting at 21 seconds is same of Nirvana opening riff but slowed down , and the arrangement of vocals / guitar at 1 min 21 secs sounds like the chorus of the Nirvana song - when Kurt goes Heyyy , Waaaait , etc) had major influence on Nirvana- Heart Shaped Box , The U-Men - Bad Little Woman (two guitar notes played at very beginning of song at 1 sec, 13 secs , etc) influenced Nirvana- Smells Like Teen Spirit (two notes played during verses) , Beatles - While My Guitar Gently Weeps (guitar riff throughout song , 3:53) and Led Zeppelin - Babe I'm Gonna Leave You (guitar riff starting at beginning of song) inspired guitar riff of Nirvana- In Bloom



Also recently added:

Black Flag- Nothing Left Inside (intro, drums) influenced Nirvana- Scentless Apprentice , The Shaggs- We Have A Savior (guitar riff, starting at 26 seconds and especially at 2:50) definitely influenced Nirvana- Lithium, The Vibrators- Petrol guitar riff influenced Nirvana- Lounge Act, The Skulls- On Target guitar riff influenced Nirvana- Territorial Pissings, Big Boys- Sound On Sound guitar riff influence on Nirvana- Come As You Are, Dead Moon- Diamonds In The Rough guitar riff same as Nirvana- Lounge Act , The Jesus Lizard- Whirl guitar riff at 1:43 sounds like Nirvana- Aneurysm


I also recently added: 

Scratch Acid - El Espectro has the riff that influenced Nirvana- Mexican Seafood , Dead Moon- Don't Burn The Fires for Nirvana- About A Girl , I can hear the Dead Moon- Already Gone influence in Nirvana- Heart Shaped Box , Dead Moon - Parchment Farm and Wipers - Way of Love riff for Nirvana- Breed  , Julian Cope - World Shut Your Mouth and Transvision Vamps- Baby I Don't Care influence on Nirvana- Smells Like Teen Spirit , Dead Moon- Walking On My Grave (guitar riff, starting at 14 seconds) compared with Nirvana- Drain You guitar riff , The Rats - Secrets guitar riff compared with Nirvana - Territorial Pissings , The Rats- Nightline guitar riff compared to Nirvana- Lounge Act , Neoboys- I'm Free guitar riff compared to Nirvana- About A Girl

***Disclaimer: The purpose of this whole post is to find the influences that Kurt had and lead us to new music discovery from artist/ songs we haven't heard before. Kurt even said that he wanted people to hear Nirvana and dig deeper into finding out who influenced them and discover bands such as Flipper and Black Flag. That being said...

Kurt even said in his journals and interviews that he ripped other bands off. Did you hear Nirvana- Been a son ? Same riff as Zebra- don't walk away. 4 skins- on the streets same riff as polly. In a link from KAOs radio he said that his song is a ripoff coming from his own mouth (see link in comments section). I am confident that Kurt Cobain ripped off riffs , vocals , drums , etc. for every song he 'wrote'. I would really like to go through every Nirvana album starting with Bleach and ending with In Utero; namely identifying the riff and other song components he ripped off from for every song in each album. I would like to make this the most comprehensive Nirvana ripoff list ever. Kurt even mentioned and blatantly said he ripped other artists off and Nirvana is the world's biggest cover band because of it. Kurt is my all time favorite artist. It is like trying to find the recipe behind your favorite food. I want to understand his songwriting process better and it will lead me to other great songs / artists that inspired Kurt. I love Kurt and his music. It changed my life and is a staple in my childhood. I would like to dig deeper into his inspirations and be influenced by the exact same songs that inspired him as an artist.

Rolling Stone is legacy media and made for generations that have passed me up. I don't need to hear about women's issues or even men's. Just give me that sweet rock and roll.

334,My Band‚Äôs First EP,"Hello everyone! My band (JADE.) and I made our first EP titled ‚ÄúBlurred‚Äù.  It‚Äôs been pretty crazy these last few months. Basically, we released a single on SoundCloud called Petals. It was a simple acoustic song with me and my girlfriend. Within the first week it reached over 3,000 listens which was bizarre, and we came into contact with the lead singer of a band called ‚ÄúOh, Weatherly‚Äù.  We decided to co-write an EP for our band, and fly out from New Jersey to Texas to record in Blake‚Äôs studio (the lead singer).  Him and his band are signed with Hopeless Records.  We wrote the songs and structured them out over a few months on FaceTime calls. Now we finally have it out on Spotify and it would mean a lot to us if you could spare 15 minutes to give an honest opinion. I‚Äôm the lead guitarist and backup vocals. My girlfriend is the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. We currently don‚Äôt have a drummer or bassist but will eventually! We hope you enjoy! If you‚Äôd like to follow us, our Instagram is @jadetheband and our twitter is @_jadetheband_ Thanks!

Especially watching them live. Just the combination of all the crazy lights, soulful sounds coming from their instruments, David Gilmour‚Äôs voice, just overall the vibes is so powerful. 

Only 20 years old so I never got to see Pink Floyd fully together live but I did see Roger Waters in 2017 and holy hell did I ball my eyes out like a little baby. And that was WITHOUT David, Rick, and Nick. I can‚Äôt even imagine what a full Pink Floyd concert must‚Äôve been like. 

Even though I‚Äôll never see them all together live. Seeing Roger live was an incredible experience that I will cherish forever and tell my future kids about. 

Let‚Äôs pray David doesn‚Äôt retire and does another tour. He would be even more incredible. 

I got into Floyd because of my dad and he would tell me all the stories of concerts he‚Äôd had gone to in his day with his friends when he was my age and how none was like Pink Floyd. 

All the days my dad and his friends would just hang out in the basement or the backyard sitting around a fire jamming to Pink Floyd and smoking a joint made me tear up too. 

I wish I could experience moments like that with my friends. Sadly I‚Äôm the only one into rock enough. 

I know how cringe it is for some people to hear ‚ÄúI was born in the wrong generation‚Äù but even though I was born as a Gen Z. I wish I was born in the fucking 60‚Äôs. I really do.

306,Almost all the same old factory pop synth crap rock,"tl; dr modern rock sucks, at least what Billboard considers rock

I stopped listening to modern music a few years ago, saw Greta Van Fleet on SNL last weekend and they really kicked ass.  I know they are a rehash of 70s hard rock legends but they sound great and do have some originality.  This got me looking into what else is out there right now, so I pulled up Billboards top 25 rock of 2018 critics picks.

[https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8490133/best-rock-songs-2018-top-25](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8490133/best-rock-songs-2018-top-25)

What a friggen waste land.  Same old synth pop over produced emo crap.  Slipknot kicks ass, but is harder than I am usually into.  Being young in the 80s and 90s I was glad to see a ska band show up. This The 1975 crap, I thought emo was dead and it is in no way improved by auto-tune and what the frig does the band or music have to do with 1975 except trying to exploit the whole retro thing.   

I can go on and on but I just felt a need to express my disappointment with what is considered the best of modern rock.  My final test was to play four or five of them at the same time.   It all sounded the same, it all bleeds together.    

I am sure I will get roasted for this rant but I will ignore most comments unless they can provide pointers to real rock and roll music.

356,Rock the Genre - Trendline,"Rock Fiends!!!!!!!!

If you'll allow me to ramble - probably the most obvious change in the genre of Rock Music in the last 15 years, has been the unavoidably awesome BLUES-driven rhythms and riffs of some now well-established bands.  There's no doubt The Black Keys, Jack White and some other big name brand bands helped turn that tide in terms of style and approach - and that countless bands have come to the forefront of this sub-genre since.  Even the phenomenon currently known as Greta probably owes a small tip of the hat to the Keys and some of the other heavyweights that have brought the Blues Rock genre to the crest of the mainstream in the last decade and a half.  

That said - 2 questions for everybody.  Even the regular lurkers and non-posters too, k??

1. Who was most responsible for contributing to this Blues Rock resurgence besides Jack White and the Keys, and bands of that ilk.  And who, besides Gary Clark Jr. is poised to carry it forward in your eyes?  Looking for some education here, so go FAR and WIDE with some names!
2. In terms of genre, while there's been an Indie surge behind Surf Rock, Shoegaze and Garage - What do you think or even hope (as either a FAN, CREATOR or BOTH) is the **NEXT** wave..?  What are y' all hungry for more of..??

Lemmy was on record saying he liked his version better; I am not sure I completely agree but it is fantastic. I love that song, both the Stones version and this one!

Every time I see that ad, I can't help myself when I press mute or change the channel. It's poor taste, poor judgement, and... It's just plain bad ju-ju. Long live Motorhead, thank you Lemmy for making the soundtrack to so many good times of my life.

### Fresh  Finnish fuzz rock band Atomic Annie release¬†a new single and video  today together with¬†Turku Rock Academy¬†and¬†V.R. Music.¬†On the music  video¬†singer¬†Benjamin Str√∂msund plays an autobiographigal¬†role as a  shady small town¬†rock star. Watch a video on¬†[YouTube](https://youtu.be/de6aoLH0Bew), listen to the song on¬†[music services](http://fanlink.to/atomicannie)¬†or download as a¬†[package](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dp6ndkcbo75r5sm/AACQlpRV1jHgYXe0KpvNGew7a?dl=0)¬†for editorial use.

Atomic  Annie plays groovy fuzz rock with psychedelic¬†bluesy influences. Adding  a very strong vocalist to the old school two guitar band sound you get  the sound of¬†Annie - beautiful but deadly!  
 

The story of Annie began in the year 2017 in Southern Finland when  five¬†music loving dudes got together and formed a band. Despite the  young age, Annie has played numerous club and festival gigs in Finland  (including Ruisrock, Finlands biggest festival) and has done a few  visits to Sweden. And the band is just getting started!  
 The lyrical themes are based around personal issues. Even though the  themes may be a bit darker, Annie spreads energy and joy when playing  live and loves to have a good time with the audience!  
 

*'Insane' paints a picture of a person that has sunken deep in his  own, slightly twisted thoughts. The person is full of fear and hatred,  and he surrounds himself with walls and fences. But in the end it‚Äôs not  clear if he‚Äôs insane or if he‚Äôs the only sane person in this world.*  
 *When recording, the band tried to keep the sound as organic as possible.  Drums, bass and rhythm guitars are recorded live and vocals are  recorded by long takes instead of singing one line at a time.*  
 

Atomic Annie is influenced by such bands as **The Black Keys, Queens of the Stone Age** and **Black Sabbath**.  
 

Atomic Annie is:  
 **Benjamin Str√∂msund** \- Vocals &amp; Harmonica  
 **Eemeli Tammero** \- Guitar  
 **Robin Lindberg** \- Guitar  
 **Santeri Kuokka** \- Drums  
 **Topi Lindqvist** \- Bass

The band requested a moment of silence and held a quick break between songs to pay tribute to Scott Weiland (who passed away in Minneapolis in 2015),  Chris Cornell, Chester Bennington, and Minneapolis's own, Prince. Disturbed's lead singer, David Draiman, told the crowd that we must fight for our loved ones and support those who are currently struggling, before it's too late. 

Draiman also read to the crowd a fan's heartfelt letter that was given to him during a meet and greet before the show, detailing the impact Disturbed's new album, Evolution, had on them after the sudden and tragic passing of their father. Draiman invited the fan and her boyfriend onto the stage for the performance of their song, 'The Light'. The band paid its respects by dedicating the Minneapolis show to the fan's deceased father.

123,Searching for a rock/indie/surf song!,"The audio sample: https://clyp.it/w0t2h44y#

Or something like ""and i-i-i-i-i-i-iiiiiii, don't know what to sa-aaay, doesn't matter anywaaay""... I have no idea actually how the lyrics go.

The song reminded me a lot of something from The Beach Boys, but I listened to some of their songs and I can't find it. It also reminded me a bit of Eels, but it's way more uptempo. I guess you can classify the song I'm looking for as a indie-rock song with some surfrock vibes. Probably some Tame Impala-vibes as well.

I THINK it's from the 90's, maybe even the 00's as it sounds a bit dated (but I guess that could also be just the band's style).

208,Unpopular: Creed was actually a good band,"I get it. Some people don't like the Pearl Jam/STP type of sound that Creed tried to do in the late 90's/early 00's, but the group was very talented instrumentally and vocally. 

My Own Prison, Human Clay, and Weathered all did great saleswise. The songs had positive meanings on top of great riffs by Tremonti. Stapp was excessive at times, but he was the perfect stage presence and voice to take some of those songs (Higher, Weathered, Torn, My Own Prison) into overdrive. No other front man could have sold with this band as well. I also think Scott Phillips is one of the more underrated drummers in the rock world. He's great for AB, but his Creed work (What If) stands out too. 

The band gets a bad wrap, and I get that people attribute a lot of it to Stapp or the label of it being Christian Rock, but I've listened to this band thousands of times, and I've always enjoyed the music every single time. Dark lyrics, uplifting lyrics, rough/edgy lyrics, Creed did it all. It really shouldn't be a wonder why they were such a box success on radio and album sales.

I always had a few songs but only cause they are classics. Just about 2 months ago though, i decided to listen to my old school Tony Hawk Pro Skater soundtracks and from there, explored deep into Punk. I am completely in love with punk now and have racked up over 300 songs that get me pumped like crazy. However, I only explore for new songs in my playlist when i‚Äôm super high and decide to workout. Punk and weed make my workouts beyond intense. It makes me feel like i‚Äôm abducted by aliens and i‚Äôm inside some human research laboratory and they are studying to see how much the human body can take physically; which in turn, makes me push myself while working out in fear that the aliens will scold me for not giving them accurate data for their studies.

245,Thoughts on Greta Van Fleet?,"So I recently found out about this band. My buddies mentioned how they sound exactly like Led Zeppelin. I thought it was a cool concept and I checked them out on Spotify. Immediately dug it. And they‚Äôre younger too? Incredible! I was on board with them at first.

I watched their video and some interviews and I thought it was funny at first that they refuse to even acknowledge Led Zeppelin exists at times. I thought it was weird but hey- this kid has a weird Australian accent that comes in and out even though they‚Äôre from Detroit so that‚Äôs not really the weirdest thing about them. I thought the lack of mentioning Zeppelin was amusing if anything.

I decided that I wanted to see what they do live so I looked up videos of them on YouTube. Immediately, my opinion of them changed. Their performances don‚Äôt make sense. Their shows are weirdly rehearsed in some aspects. The way they do the old 80s move where the guitarist and singer sing into the same mic. They don‚Äôt do it with passion though. They do it as if it was some managements idea.

I knew some hardcore Zeppelin fans but these guys are something else. These guys grew up listening to Zeppelin and Zeppelin alone. They‚Äôre siblings so I‚Äôm assuming their father is some hardcore Zeppelin fan. It‚Äôs also pretty safe to assume that these guys have been doing this a while right? Nobody gets this good at imitating someone in one night right? That‚Äôs when I started to get the idea that these guys are probably being managed by some weird hardcore Zeppelin fanatic. Their dad (I‚Äôm assuming) probably taught them at a young age how to act sing and perfectly replicate Zeppelin moves. Even their interviews sound like they‚Äôre exactly what a middle aged rocker would say.

Can you imagine the band meeting if this weren‚Äôt the case? ‚ÄúHey guys I have an idea.. let‚Äôs sit around, study all these Led Zeppelin DVD‚Äôs, copy Robert Plants hand gestures, write riffs that sound exactly like Zeppelin but act like we like other bands too. I know we put so much effort into sounding and looking like Zeppelin, but if anyone asks who‚Äôs your main influence just say Aerosmith.‚Äù

What I‚Äôm saying is, this was some weirdly preplanned band from the mind of a middle aged guy who can‚Äôt let go of the fact that his favorite band doesn‚Äôt exist.

However on rare occasion I hear some piece of (almost always) instrumental sound which just 'clicks' with me, that I just can't seem to find in bands / well known music, I always considered it a type of Rock sound, but I can't really give it a genre name or even find any bands who actively put this kind of sound out.

I love almost every thing that both bands did (even some of the Brian Howe era of Bad Co). I love Paul Rodgers' voice. Simon Kirke(the drummer for both bands) was the guy I really fell in ""love"" with. He released a solo album in 2011 that is really worth checking out called Filling the Void. A great album, imo.

Free were much more than just ""All Right Now"". While that song is great, they had even better songs: Wishing Well, Fire and Water, and the Stealer just to name a few. I give all 6 of their studio albums, at least a 4 star rating.

318,Why is Jim Morrison so revered?,"I've been listening to a bunch of The Doors music and yes, they were a great band and he was an excellent singer who suited them perfectly, but what made him so special that his name is so well known, even to those who don't listen to his music? I knew his name way before I ever heard any of his songs, I've seen his face graffitied all around the world, seen hundreds of posters and shirts with him on them and it made me wonder why.

It's similar to Kurt Cobain, who everyone knows his name, everyone wears Nirvana shirts even if they aren't fans of the band, but I know that he was a social activist and that there was a huge scandal around his death which made him even more famous, and also Nirvana made a huge change in the musical landscape of the time. 

Are the two comparable in this aspect? What influence did Jim and The Doors have on the world and musical landscape?",rock,1546243470,Stealpawya,0,1,True,2018-12-31

346,Bryan Adams: Cut's Like A Knife needs a deluxe edition,"I'm a huge Bryan Adams fan and have been for quite a while (since the early 90's). 

I remember reading about how Bryan does not believe or want to release an album called ""Greatest Hits"" Which technically he hasn't (So Far So Good, Best of Me and Anthology). 

There are a few live albums.

BUT.... to the subject! He has released only one album in the deluxe format (where everyone else seems to do their whole back catalogue) . The Reckless deluxe album is great! I just find it irritating that no other album has had the same treatment. Who else wants more deluxe reissues?

I mean, I saw him on the Waking Up The Neighbours 20th Anniversary Tour - no remastered album. A few years back 18 til i die was 20 - no remaster. Obviously Cut's Like a Knife and Into The Fire are due for remastered deluxe treatments.

On top of what I consider an anomaly Bryan gives these snipets from the ""squeaky chair"" last year, the anniversary year of Into The Fire - I thought theses were a tease for the reissue but it appears they were just for fun.

32,"Need help finding songs in a certain ""sub-genre"" (not the right phrase)","I just want to be clear, this isn't a playlist. I only used the songs below as examples of the ""genre"" I'm talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the years, I've noticed a certain group of songs that sort of fit together while being in different sub-genres. I searched around a bit and I found the closest thing to what I'm describing are rock epics, songs with key changes and/or multiple time signatures that are generally longer. I have to admit, as mainstream as it might sound to you, this might be my favorite type of music. However, if this was what I was looking for, I wouldn't be posting this. I think my personal definition of a 'rock epic' is a little broader. A short list of songs that might explain this could include: 

Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody

Kansas - Carry On Wayward Son

The Beatles - A Day In The Life

Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb

The Who - Baba O'Riley

Black Sabbath - War Pigs

I would even go far as to say Green Day - Jesus of Suburbia.

As you can see, this isn't contained to a sub-genre, and it surely doesn't include many famous epics like Stairway to Heaven or Free Bird. The best common link I can think of is their dense instrumentation and/or harmonies. Maybe they really don't have a link but if you see one, could you name some more songs that might fit in here?

140,The Greta van Fleet of Prog Rock???,"They're called ""Laika"" and they just popped out of nowhere last Friday. These guys really remind me of Greta van Fleet; a new, modern band bringing back an old classic rock style. Unlike Greta van Fleet that sounds like Led Zeppelin, these guys are like Rush, but with a female vocalist. They've got an awesome style, really neat sound, and a great, modern and punky take on old classic prog-rock. Check them out!

269,I feel like I'm going insane. I'm sorry for the rant.,"I can't find a single modern band that isn't emo, screamo, stoners, or things like that. What happened to bands that told stories with melodic music, with harmonies? What happened to light sounds, and fun? Is it so bad to fall into categories like power pop, pop punk, or something that was popular a few decades ago like surf or blues rock without adding an aspect of heaviness or one of the things I mentioned in my first sentence? Where's the piano or keyboard, without adding an electronic aspect? Some of the only modern bands I can think of that I like are Weezer, Muse, Nothing but Thieves, and GVF. Who cares that GVF sound like Led Zeppelin? Maybe some people like that early heavy metal sound! If so many people have the same problem I do, why isn't there more music that's more accessible? It's infuriating and makes me lose some hope in the genre, to be honest. I'm sorry to be such a downer but I've been really annoyed and bummed about this recently.

383,What‚Äôs Considered Rock?," I haven‚Äôt really posted here before, but I‚Äôve been kind of hearing a lot of people saying Queen was the greatest rock band ever, and I can‚Äôt really agree. I love Queen, they‚Äôve got so many great songs, and of course Live Aid was amazing. Also, I‚Äôve seen this mostly on YouTube videos like WatchMojo, which aren‚Äôt really that great either, and all the posts praising Queen range from the November 2018 period when Bohemian Rhapsody was released.
 Contrary to this, I tend to find proto-metal rock bands like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Black Sabbath more rock-ish, as well as other groups like AC/DC and Grand Funk Railroad (At least their earlier stuff). 
 Everyone‚Äôs entitled to an opinion, I just wanted to hear other people‚Äôs opinions. 
 Like, on the same thread, I don‚Äôt really consider The Who or Pink Floyd rock, because they kind of transcend traditional rock, which is why I don‚Äôt really agree with them being super high on classic rock lists. 
 I dunno, I‚Äôll probably get downvoted by Queen  lovers which is fair, but I wanted to get some outside views. 
 I also acknowledge there are sub genres of rock that these bands could fit into. I could see Queen being put into Pop Rock, but I wouldn‚Äôt put them super high on a pure rock list, just like how I‚Äôd but Cream more in Psychedelic or Blues Rock. I just don‚Äôt see the claiming of Queen as the greatest rock band ever doesn‚Äôt really have basis in fact. ",rock,1543720420,Eholub24,61,1,True,2018-12-01

396,One of My Favorite Albums By Another Band AND One of My Own Songs :),"Rather than just spam this board with one of my own songs, I'm going to start out by talking about one of my favorite albums. It's Transatlanticism by Death Cab For Cutie. Some people describe it as emo, all I know is that it's one of the most unique albums ever created. Ben Gibbard is a genius both in songwriting and his ability to write poetic lyrics. He's an incredibly talented Guitarist and Pianist too, and what a voice. I really think he is one of the most talented musicians of our era. If you've never heard this album please do yourself a favor and listen to Tiny Vessels, Transatlanticism, and Passenger Seat in order. It is the best 3 song transition I've ever heard on an album, all 3 songs are incredible and just flow seamlessly into each other.

As for my own music, I don't know how to describe my sound, and I'm looking for some feedback on that. I kind of think I fall somewhere in the Death Cab/Jeff Buckley/Alice In Chains area stylistically. I would never claim to be as good as any of those artists. I just think I might be a similar style. I'd really like some outside perspectives though. How would you describe my sound to someone else? What genre would you tell someone I am?

Here's one of my songs, please feel free to check out my other songs as well if you like it. They can all be found at the same place. If you take the time to listen thanks so much in advance.

496,"Surviving a show in the San Francisco rock ""scene"" - Swaybone stories #1","Swaybone stories - #1  October 24, 2018

As Rawn and I pulled up to the Brick and Mortar club in San Francisco we are greeted by members of the other bands who inform me that the club is pissed off at me. Thus begins another Swaybone gig. (Cue music ""Stayin' Alive"").

I am going to give you a day in the life of a local rock band trying to make it in the Bay Area ""music scene"". I will try to illuminate some of the facets of the rock and roll music scene as I experience them in my band Swaybone. This is not a satire, and events are closer than they appear. 

The booking person is at the venue, which is unusual, and he is very displeased that there have been no ticket pre-sales for our show, and that we are late for load-in. Wow, that's all true. I am actually the person responsible for putting this show together, and persuaded the three other bands to join us on the bill. Now the other bands and I are concerned that the whole show is about to be scuttled because it doesn't look like it will be profitable for the venue. In my view, that outcome would represent a defeat.

Chris, my drummer, and I made a quick decision. Should we try to make this gig happen, or give up on it? I didn't want to disappoint any of the fans that might show up for my band, or the other bands, so we decided to do it. Now I had to persuade the booking person to let us play.
The booking person told me he was on the phone with the owner of the club, who was in Israel at the moment, and who was conveying orders in real time. The terms of the show have changed. One band has dropped out at the last minute (lame excuses) - the three bands can play if they start immediately and finish by 10pm (!) Swaybone is a yes, and the other two bands are a yes, and the show is on!

We cleared the stage for the second band, Partly Foggy, who had just enough room on stage for seven members. A few more fans trickled in. Their set consisted of covers of mostly seventies tunes, with tasty solos from their violinist, and their guitarist Steve Kraft. Their lead singer worked admirably to get the small crowd involved, and I videotaped their show for them. 

Next up was the Woo Woos, fronted by two female singers offering covers of mostly Nineties hits. I was struck by how downbeat and depressing the lyrics are of bands like Garbage, and all the other songs they covered that night, which were replete with dark human emotions, low/no empathy, unhappiness, coldness, faux alienation, etc. I love the music of the Nineties, but it reminded me of how hard it was to find my own voice as a singer during that time period, because virtually every band that I might emulate, except for Creed and Live refused to sing about Joy.

In fact, this body of music is particularly triggering for Swaybone's bassist Rawn, and I noticed he was starting to load our equipment out in the middle of the last band's set. As a reflex, I started helping him load out, 'cause I was kind of getting bummed out by the lyrics too. I knew I had no reason to expect to get paid, so there was no other compelling reason to stay. If the last band had been an original band, I'm sure we would have stayed til the end. Anyway, the club got their pay-to-play $300 from the bands, so I had no further items to settle with them. 
Rawn and I screamed out of there, laughing, not knowing if the show was a success or a disaster, or both. The factors that nearly sunk this show are the same ubiquitous factors that have dogged my rock career for over thirty years - never enough money to promote the band, take time off work, pay for transportation and rehearsals, and aggressively, consistently book enough shows to build our fan base. Our band has been stuck in a catch-22 endless loop at the bottom of the music industry in the Bay Area, and the case of Swaybone is a perfect reflection of a rock industry that has been in a decades-long process of self-inflicted decline.

But we are Swaybone, and we are bringing our brand of original classic rock to the world, and helping to create a new cooperatively based rock industry to replace the old freemasonic/mafia/illuminati/CIA controlled sham that rock and roll has become. 
Anyway, here are the vital statistics of the show:
1. Transportation costs: $60
2. Rehearsal/transportion costs: $100
3. Poster printing: $5
4. Pay-to-play: $30
5. Pre-sale tickets: 0
6. Paid by venue: 0
7. CD's sold: 0
8. T-shirts sold: 0
9. Paying fans: 2
10. New fans: 1 (Xuscha)",rock,1544360362,darjuth,0,1,True,2018-12-09

2. King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard - Not for everyone but those who like the experimental weirdness of Gizzard will be instantly captivated by the dedicated musicians and their obsessive fanbase. Watch Middle 8's videos about them for more enticing info.

Key Songs: Gizzard is a band that requires you to listen to the full albums, individual songs don't do them justice. Nonagon Infinity and I'm In Your Mind Fuzz are good places to start.


3. The Kings of Frog Island - Like playing a Sabbath song on .75 speed. Kings of Frog Island have mastered slow and groovy psychedelic rock, so refreshing to hear in the 2010s.

Key Songs: Welcome To The Void, Hallucination, The Longest Hour

255,"Does anyone else find an entire song or parts of a song that are either chaotic, hardcore, or otherwise non-relaxing strangely soothing?","I honestly think that the ending guitar riff for Turning Japanese by The Vapors is slowly becoming one of my all-time favorites despite it having gone unnoticed by me across a decade of having known the song well. This is not because of its technicality, but rather because the unique chiming sounds during the solo are slowly becoming nostalgic to me. I have no idea why, I was not raised on the song, and am well aware of the song's at times controversial lyrics, and the chorus itself does not relax me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other examples for me include:

\-A relentlessly nightmarish chorus of harsh vocals and the following guitar solo from a death metal/deathgrind song called Hour of Rats by The Red Chord.

\-Obstacle 1 by Interpol is extremely emotional for me, typically not in a relaxing way, as it's tied to trauma I've experienced. But recently I can't help but absent-mindedly smile and bob my head along to it slowly now.

\-The Outsider by A Perfect Circle is one of the most heartbreaking songs I've ever heard, on top of it being very depressing in my opinion lyrically. Despite not being able to really pull myself together to listen to the song much anymore, the opening guitar riff is probably one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard.

&amp;#x200B;

Anything you'd want to add to this list if you can think of even a simple song-name is much appreciated. Generally sticking to Rock/Metal/Alternative/Punk for this, I don't want people's comments about other genres to get removed here due to the moderation.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What bands try to spread positive perspectives with their music?

&amp;#x200B;

Did you know even if negative themes can help to create music for people to not feel alone in their struggles, or to bolster the strength of the group, you can do more by trying to do it in positive ways for people because it can give them actionable ideas and hope? It's a rare wisdom because it only comes from the kinds of people who don't become trapped by the negative thinking programmed into us via media and school formats.

&amp;#x200B;

The answer I always get when I ask the question ""How could we best handle this if it were the only problem in a perfect world?"" is by far a waaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyy better solution, and if it's impossible, getting as close as I can is always waaaayyyyyy better than anything that's ever come out of a negative worldview. If we all practiced this more when speaking to and helping one another, it wouldn't be so long before the perfect world was ours. So I want all positivity for my family's music, and I want to ROOOOOOCK.

I really like music that feels big, larger than life. I loved the electronic takes that the album has, as well as the crazy space rock influences.

I'm more of a rock and roll, hard rock and metal kind of guy, but I'm going through a phase now where I'm looking for other music genres. I really like synthwave, dreamweave, trip hop, lo-fi and industrial.

So, having all of that said (really sorry for keeping it short), could you guys recommend me any artist or album that resembles Black Holes and Revelations?

Thank u so much guys, you're super awesome!

1. It's music I like (strong melody, interesting instrumentation, good lyricism). This is obviously subjective, but you can get a general rundown of the kinds of genres/songs I like from the Twitter page (e.g., I know this subreddit has a lot of music posted already, I'm looking for something specific).
2. It's fairly new.
3. It's got some interesting/unique elements to it.
4. (unless I REALLY like it) it's from a less well-known artist / hasn't really blown up yet.
5. Quality, not quantity. I don't feature a lot of songs, but I want to stand by each one as top-notch.

&amp;#x200B;

I just bough a rock in a small market place in the Reunion Island. The rock comes from Madagascar and I find it really beautiful.

The vendor told me that the piece I bough was a natural rock formation. However, I am really doubtful about it. I think it is more an ""artisanal realization"". How can I discover the truth ?

&amp;#x200B;

Here some pictures of the rock : [https://imgur.com/a/lkgVPIq](https://imgur.com/a/lkgVPIq)

As you can see, there is two different colors between the rock behind and the ammonites which make me think it is more a realization made by someone.

Any comments is welcome !!! :) 

&amp;#x200B;

The truth does not really matter as I still think the whole piece is still wonderful :)

Each of these albums presents a story (Animals is a retelling of a book) that is deep and real, so it's easy to connect with them.

252,Best rock album from the 2000s?,"To me, 2000s music is the strongest of all the other decades. Especially for rock music.

I want to know what y'all think the absolute best rock/metal album from the 2000s is. Might be a tough choice, but I've been thinking for a while and I narrowed my choice down to Green Day's American Idiot. Arguably the best concept album ever, American Idiot is full of chart-topping hits, catchy hooks, well crafted riffs, and amazing lyrics. Green Day's best performance, easily. Any track can bang in the car, but this album is meant for a deeper listen. The story is full of twists and turns and ends in quite a satisfactory way.

My personal favorite album from this era is My Chemical Romance's The Black Parade, though. I think it's an underrated gem that unfairly gets thrown in with the generic pop punk released from 2005-2007. I'd honestly throw it in with the top ten best LPs from the 2000s - American Idiot, Madvillainy, Game Theory, and the like.

Then you would wake up super early on a Sunday morning, depending on how big the band was. You‚Äôd get to the Warehouse Records or whatever other vender sold Bass tickets or Ticketmaster. You‚Äôd get there at 5 or 6 in the morning for tickets that went on sale at 10am.  

You‚Äôd hope to be first in line, but there was always a few guys before you. Two or three real fans and some super nerdy tech guy who was there just to scalp the tickets at a later date. Fuck that guy, that guys a piece of shit, am I right?  

It would be cold and damp and unwelcoming  You didn‚Äôt care because you could talk about the band, your band, the band you all are there to buy tickets for. Of course there is some guy who has already seen them four or five times.  There‚Äôs always that guy, but you love him because he‚Äôs got all the info; the set list, the band gossip, he knows it all. 

A little more time goes by and the line starts filling in behind you. Somebody always walks up and ask if you guys are in line for Kiss, or Nirvana or Alive In Chains, whatever the big tour was at the time that was about to hit your town. 

It‚Äôs cold and damp, but you don‚Äôt care because there would be dozens of people in line with you and you all loved the same band. At school very few liked your music, but in this line of misfits and music loving losers, we all loved the same shit. 

Of course there‚Äôs always some middle aged guy surrounded by us young kids who‚Äôs there ‚Äújust to buy tickets for Barry Manilow‚Äù or some other lame shit. But he‚Äôs cool and friendly and harmless and just tries to relate to the rocker kids that he‚Äôs surrounded by. 

The final hour hits; anticipation builds. Then the first employee walks up to the door. Usually a late thirties single mom.  You can tell she has lived life and seen some shit in her day. She walks up, with a coffee in her hand and says,‚Äùhey guys!‚Äù  We all say hi back and ask when she‚Äôs going to open up. She says soon and makes a wisecrack joke at our expense.  We all laugh. She clicks the door unlocked,  promises to open up soon and clicks the door locked behind her. 

Momentum is building.  You start talking more to the other guys standing in line further behind you. More record store employees show up. The opening manager would let them in one by one. You could see them setting up through the window. They‚Äôre talking to each other. You can see them talking about us. Every so often they would raise their eyebrows and take a peek at the line. 

With ten minutes or so an employee would walk to the door and open it. There‚Äôs slight hope that they are going to open the door early and let us in, but nope,‚Äùsorry guys, I‚Äôm just going to get coffee.‚Äù  Dozens of us groan; reacting to their every move. 

With just a few minutes left before 10AM, they let us in a bit early. Oh, because those tickets go on sale AT TEN on the dot. And we are not just competing with each other, but all of the other bass ticket and Ticketmaster outlets across the country. And you were convinced that there were dozens of others standing in lines at every ticket outlet around the world just to get your tickets. The very tickets you were suppose to get. 

The clock would strike ten and boom the first sale had started. There‚Äôs three guys ahead of you. What‚Äôs taking the first guy so long. Every second he takes is a second I could loose a better seat to somebody else in the world.   A  minute goes buy and everybody else besides the actual guy at the counter start looking at each other. What‚Äôs taking this guy so long?  Come on already. Hurry up.  Finally the first guy is done and walks away from the counter and the second guy moves up to buy his tickets. 

The first guy walks by and says good luck. But now we have to ask what seats he got.  The very guy we we‚Äôre just talking shit about for taking too long, we are now asking what seats he got in the friendliest manner.  He is no longer our enemy; our competition. He no longer is the focus of our impatience and hate. That had now moved on to the second guy who‚Äôs at the counter, and of course HE‚ÄôS TAKING FOREVER. What‚Äôs with people. Get your tickets and get the fuck out of the way. 

So we ask the first guy where his seats are. He says the third row.  THIRD ROW?  Third row, how did you get third row. You were first in line. You were there before the tickets even went on sale.  And your third row?  How did you get stuck with third row?  If this guy is third, I‚Äôm going to be in the rafters. WTF?!  Move this line already. 

Finally, it‚Äôs my turn, all of sudden all your anger and impatience disappears and you have the biggest smile on your face. She asks you what concert you want to buy tickets for. Don‚Äôt play dumb with me. You know what tickets I‚Äôm here for lady. I‚Äôm not here to play games. I‚Äôm here for the band, the same band we‚Äôre all in line for except for the old Berry Manilow fanilow. Within seconds I say hi and confess my love for Smashing Pumpkins or Rage Against the Machine or whatever other bad I was buying tickets for all at the same time.  

Finally she takes your cash, credit cards took too long. Every second you wait for a credit card approval is a second ten other people around the world is buying your seat out from under you; cash it is. Cash is king.  She quickly reads off your section, seat location and seat number for approval. Sure lady, whatever you say.  Just print the tickets.  We don‚Äôt have time to waste.

Finally you hear the click of the enter button on her computer, the special machine spits out one ticket. And then another.   Finally she presents you with the pair or tickets, side by side, parallel to each other. The tickets are on beautiful shiny white card stock with blue ink. 

She quickly confirms the details of the tickets.  You‚Äôre not even listening to her anymore. You hear nothing.  You are in your own little world.  You just see your bands name on that beautiful shinny card-stock: Metallica, No Cameras/No Bottles.  She shuffled a grey folder towards you and shows you on a shitty piece of white paper a seat-chart covered in plastic, your seat location.  Oh my god, I‚Äôm on the floor, mid first section twelve rows from the front. This is good. This is very good. Then she asks to initial next to the bass fish on the ticket, no refunds, no exchanges!

54,"New Book out about former Kansas frontman, Steve Walsh","Just on the heels of his 4th solo album, *Black Butterfly*, a new book is out about one of Classic Rock‚Äôs most iconic vocalists and keyboard players:

https://i.redd.it/91wf3424kjg11.jpg

***When They Call Out Your Name, Steve Walsh*** is a pictorial trek through his stellar career with stories from Steve himself, his peers, as well as quotes from radio.¬† The foreword is by famed rock photographer Neal Preston, several of his photos are featured - some never before released.  More full color photos from the author and other rock photographers. 

Available at [**http://www.stevewalshrocks.com**](http://www.stevewalshrocks.com/)

***The 70‚Äôs provided us with many faceless bands. REO Speedwagon, Journey, Foreigner, Kansas and many more. Because we didn‚Äôt associate faces with the band, it always came down to the music, and if it moved you. But the real engine was the vocalist. And if you look back at the guys selling the songs to us, the best of the bunch was the guy in Kansas. I could never remember any of their names, well, maybe Steve Perry, but I always loved the guy‚Äôs voice singing ""Dust In the Wind"" and the others. I knew his name was Walsh, because, well, I spent over a decade managing another Walsh‚Ä¶Joe.¬† So then I hear about this book about THAT guy. Steve Walsh. And I read it. Wow, this guy was more than a singer, more than a front guy, more than a keyboard player. He is the real deal. Watching his life soar to upper rock star level, yet staying a humble and down to earth guy, is a story with intrigue, ups, downs and everything in between. I couldn‚Äôt put it down. More importantly, I‚Äôll NEVER forget Steve Walsh‚Äôs name. He really put a face on one of those faceless bands. -*** **David Spero (Executive at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,  manager for Dickey Betts and more. Former clients include Joe Walsh, Michael Stanley, Ian Hunter, Harry Nilsson, Nicky Hopkins, Survivor, Billy Bob Thornton, Eric Carmen, Nelson, Cat Stevens and more)**

**More about Steve Walsh:**

Steve Walsh's distinguished place in the music world runs the gamut from being a familiar, friendly voice on commercial radio for decades- ¬†to forging into new progressive territory. 

His distinguished vocals on songs like *Carry On Wayward Son* and *Dust in the Wind* have been woven into the soundtrack of now three generations - over 30 million fans - all the while impressing new fans worldwide.

His vocals - that remain among Rock and Roll's best - are marked by emotional depth and talent beyond compare.¬† Add a charismatic stage presence and keyboard wizardry into the mix, and it is easy to see why Steve is so respected by fans and his Progressive Rock peers. ¬†

So much so that progressive rock icons like Steve Hackett of Genesis and Steve Morse of the Dixie Dregs (who would later join Kansas and Deep Purple) asked Steve to play on their albums, as well as a host of other current and legendary progressive performers seeking his expertise. ¬†

His songwriting has been a step ahead from the beginning, and helped propel Kansas placement on the Billboard Charts with tunes like *Point of Know Return* (#28) and *All I Wanted* (#19).¬† He also drove the band he formed, Streets into the top ten with *If Love Should Go*. 

Still a chart topper in recent years too, with the documentary that aired repeatedly on VH1 and Palladia, *Miracles Out of Nowhere*, and his current album *Black Butterfly* is still ¬†receiving world-wide airplay and acclaim.¬† Steve is grabbing the bar Kansas set during their peak and raising it yet another notch.¬† Steve has a truly amazing level of musicianship that can take you to another place‚Ä¶",rock,1534462800,Classic_Rock_News,0,2,True,2018-08-16

I've witnessed a lot more good covers but those 2 stood out because they were  unexpected and just rocked really hard.

79,"Discussion - Greta Van Fleet, mainstream rock revival or one-off?","Hey everyone, first time post-er here. wanted some opinions regardig Greta Van Fleet. Me and a mate have been discussing this quite extensively debating the impact Greta is having. full disclosure, this will likely be a bit lengthy as i'll be explaining this to the best of my ability to ensure anyone even without knowledge of Greta and their semi mainstream push could viably have an opinion.

Anyone unaware of them, Greta Van Fleet is a 4 man group who's sound is almost emulating Led Zep. They formed in 2012 in rural Michigan, that is where it turns out to be the end of similarities to bands of yester-year eras. 3 of the 4 members are brothers of a family who pushed them into music from birth, supplying them with a heavy interest in 70's rock and blues. In addition to instruments and education. 

While their sound is excellent, and lately they are pushing the exposure of rock in a way that hasn't been seen perhaps the early 2000's (imo). Is this really the rebirth of rock being prevalent? 

My opinion regarding the matter is that this is manufactured and highly unlikely to blow up, however my mate disagrees. i think that this shows that rock isn't ""dead"" while he thinks this is the proper revival. im curious to see other people's opinions on this matter.

I'm a huge rock music fan in all of it's various forms (particularly Metallica as you can tell by my username)

This is an edited version of the message I sent the mods when asking to be added to the mod team with a basic idea of my plans for the subreddit:


&gt; **Clean up the sidebar**

&gt; - Put the list of related reddits in a separate page
&gt; - put clear rules about what can and can't be submitted

&gt; **Stronger submission rules**

&gt; - Focus on original, rock music in all its shapes and forms

&gt; - Any band can be submitted, so long as it is ORIGINAL rock music (i.e contains guitar, bass, drums etc)

&gt; - People can submit any band, but there must be 1 month between reposts

&gt; - If people want to post their own music they must tag the song as [My Band]

&gt; **Regular Mega Threads Where People can Post Their Covers**

&gt; - This way the sub is not cluttered with lots of youtube videos of people covering more famous artists
&gt; - Bands can also post their own covers of songs from other genres


&gt; I love rock music and think this sub-reddit could be good source of new music for people that are looking to move past the old classics.

So, basically this is just a heads up about some changes you will see around here in the next few weeks. Hopefully we can help re-invigorate this sub and get some more attention on the glory of the rock genre in all it's forms.",rock,1532747422,Halo_On_Fire,18,24,True,2018-07-27

280,Why i don't like pop or rap,"So im going to preface this by saying that i am a 14 year old male, so excuse bad grammar, spelling ect. Now why might you ask do i not like a large majority of popular music of today? Well i just want to say one thing, Depth, emotion and soul (rock in specifically specifically in the 70s and 90s show this alot but thats just my opinion like this entire paragraph) That i just dont feel comes from artists in this day and age (while i don't think that all music from today is bad, personally i like a lot of what Post Malone releases, and some edm but that's not what this is about) For me there is just a certain soul and feeling that resonates from bands like Led Zeppelin, Rush, Nirvana and Alice in chains. While a lot of this i believe comes from the amount of time and effort that you had to put in a Album or Ep that you need to make a original rock song, you were almost forced to put a part of yourself into it if you were passionate. While today you can half sing something that doesnt have any meaning, put a pop snare and drum pattern behind it, and boom you have a song, while its of course harder than that, but i believe that its just common sense that to make something that sounds actually good you needed more work and soul to make a album like Bleach  or Led Zeppelin 3, vs something like Stoney by post Malone or Reputation by Taylor Swift. Which the ladder to are full of hallow lyrics with basic beats backing them. While the first two got heart and emotion that should be put into them so that they sound great, have stories that have depth to them, and are very emotional in a non synthetic and fake way. While of course im not saying that new music completely lacks emotion, the song Better Now by Post is emotional(sorry for all the Post Malone examples, some of his songs i do like which is rare for me with rap/pop/hip hop) But songs that are emotionally depth with meaning are becoming fewer and far between.

I‚Äôve been working on my album Backwood Menace for almost 2 years and although this song was originally written when I was in 11th grade. It has changed since the original version I made 5 years ago but it still has many of the same parts. 

It‚Äôs got a bit of a jazz influence and was overall an extremely fun track to write and record. My favourite parts were the chorus and the guitar solo near the end. If anyone has a few moments to spare I would greatly appreciate some feedback.

383,Best bands ever?,"For me the answer is easy. Led Zeppelin. They are the band who were like nobody else. They created a whole new kind of music, and ever since everybody has been influenced by them. They were brilliant musicians individually, but when they were together they were unstoppable. For me Robert Plant is the greatest rock singer ever, Bonzo is undoubtably the greatest rock drummer of them all (only Keith Moon comes close), John Paul Jones is in my top 5 best rock bassists and Jimmy Page is one of the best, if not the best guitarists of all time (only Hendrix can compete with him and maybe Eddie Van Halen imo).

Here's my top 3:
1. Led Zeppelin
2. The Who
3. The Rolling Stones

(The Beatles. I didn't include them, because I don't really consider them a rock band, rather a pop band. I know they have a few heavy songs like Helter Skelter, but the majority of their music is pop or pop rock. However, I do consider them a brilliant pop band, in fact the best one. )",rock,1533512079,NMate777,13,6,True,2018-08-05

Just listen to Swamp Song, and if you're someone who thinks you might not like Tool based on their later output, you might end up loving it. The whole album is just as good as that one, too.

I'd say the only bad part about the album is it's got a hidden track at the end, an odd trend from the 80s and 90s that I'm glad has largely disappeared from music.

145,Let's talk about Greta Van Fleet,"To give some context, my dad was a huge classic rock fan.  My earliest childhood memories of him are 90% rides in his truck with Pink Floyd, Lynrd Skynrd, Rush, Black Sabbath, and Zeppelin blaring from the radio.  His tastes in music imprinted on me, and I was always kind of bummed out that for the most part, classic rock is a dinosaur.  Its remnants are still around to be appreciated, but the world has not seen any new specimens in a good long time.

Then I heard Greta Van Fleet for the first time.  At first I thought I was listening to an unreleased Zeppelin song.  Then I realized that's not Robert Plant singing nor is it Jimmy Page on the guitar, but they do sound a hell of a lot alike.

And it sounds *really good*.  I dig it so much, I bought their album immediately.

They are an anachronism.  Their sound is distinctly classic rock, but this is a new band.  Look up some pictures, go watch a video, they're practically kids.  They somehow nailed the rock/folk/blues sound Led Zeppelin championed decades before any of them were born.

But is it okay for a new band to enjoy success by emulating another successful band almost 1:1?  My left brain says they should really be trying to blaze their own trail, develop their own identity and sound, stand tall on their own legs. But the right brain in me wants them to stay the course they're on.

We won't get any more Zeppelin songs.  They were one of the greatest rock bands ever, but no matter how much we want it, there will never be a new song from them.  Greta Van Fleet is the next best thing.  It's like someone went back in time, cloned early 70's era Zeppelin, brought them to the present, and now they're making new music.  How could that possibly be anything other than awesome?

247,Rock singers whose voices have aged the best- general discussion,"It's always disappointing to see a rock singer whose voice hasn't held up over time and who doesn't really give good renditions of their back catalogue any longer. So, let's celeberate the rock singers whose voices have well and truly not been withered by age. Here are just a few suggestions of mine to start off:
STEVEN TYLER has held up amazingly considering Aerosmith have been going since 1974. In particular you'd expect those famous distortion-heavy screams to have caused some damage to his vocals, but he still sounds amazing in concert and in studio, still performing in the original key by and large and doesn't seem to have lost a note.
SAMMY HAGAR, solo artist and former frontman of Van Halen, would be around 70 himself, and last I heard still sounded great, having toured with rock supergroup Chickenfoot and lent his vocal prowess to numerous other acts. Considering DLR these days tends to sound kinda crummy live, it's worth noting Sammy who took a lot of flack from some Van Halen fans during his stint in the band is still going strong.
ANN WILSON of Heart has held up tremendously well. Already such a complete singer even by the mid to late 1970s, Ann sounded as good as ever certainly up to a few years ago. Ann herself must be in her late 60s by now, but was still performing in the original key and sounding pretty solid just last year. I haven't heard any of her 2018 performances as of yet, but certainly for the best part of forty years, she was one of the best in the business.
GLENN HUGHES, formerly of Deep Purple and who has lent his talents on vocals and bass guitar to numerous other artists and groups including Tony Iommi and John Norum, if anything sounded better around age 60 than he did in his Deep Purple days nearly 40 years earlier. As recently as 2016 I saw him in concert absolutely blow all the classic Purple numbers out of the water. Ian Gillan these days isn't so good in concert, but Glenn's voice has held up phenomenally- he's still hitting all the same crazy falsetto notes as before, though he must be well into his sixties by now.
GRAHAM BONNET, finally, formerly of Rainbow as well as other groups including Alcatrazz and Impellitteri, recently celebrated his 70th birthday. He tours regularly with his own band now playing new material and classic numbers, and sounds as powerful as ever. The man called' the Amazing Iron Lung' hasn't weakened with age one bit. I'm hoping to see him this year when he comes here on tour.

I've found a /couple/ of other songs with something similar.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3hKVF-FD1w - The whole song has similar vibes to it (mostly the instrumental, but the vocals are like that too)

Anyone know songs any more songs or bands with this sort of sound?? I honestly crave this type of sound but I really can't figure out what to look up or to even call it to begin with. I guess it's my favorite type of music? Maybe. Sorry I couldn't be more specific with what I'm looking for ):

313,About Kaiser Chiefs' (possible) next album,"According to this article, Kaiser Chiefs' reunited with their old record label earlier this year:

http://www.musicweek.com/talent/read/kaiser-chiefs-reunited-with-polydor/071816

So a new album could be on the horizon!

I really digged their music as an early teenager and 'Education, Education, Education &amp; War' was absolutely brilliant in my opinion. However, their last album 'Stay Together' was a bit of a shock to me, because of their transition from rock to pop. I know that bands evolve, but this one was a bit drastic in my opinion. I still liked it though, but I really missed the rebellious tone they had on the albums prior to Stay Together.

I've got the feeling that they might return to form with their next album. Many fans were disappointed with their change in sound and Kaiser Chiefs themselves knew that too, so I really hope they do...

127,Switchfoot Heals Wounds On ‚ÄúWhere The Light Shines Through‚Äù (Review) (OC),"TL;DR: Lyrically, musically, and conceptually, Where The Light Shines Through is one of the best albums of Switchfoot‚Äôs career.

Switchfoot released Where The Light Shines Through in 2016, nearly twenty years after they released their debut album. Musically and lyrically, this album is an aggregate of their past catalogue, featuring influences drawn from each record. The album still sounds fresh and relevant in the modern music scene. 

WTLST is thoughtful and fun, and this comes out in both the lyrics and music. The album fits well into the Pop Rock category, with influences from disco (Float), anthems (Shake This Feeling), jam guitar (Where The Light Shines Through), and ballads (I Won‚Äôt Let You Go).  As with all Switchfoot albums, the feel of California beaches weaves through the music. The instruments are standard rock fare - keyboards, piano, electric / acoustic guitar, analog / digital drums ‚Äì but there is enough variety in the composition to prevent the album from becoming repetitive. This also lends itself well to the album‚Äôs musical consistency, as no song feels out of place. The production is great; listeners can expect to differentiate individual guitar parts, even the tone of distortion on songs with many layers. Jon Foreman‚Äôs vocals also have a relaxed, yet soaring quality, in each of the songs.

I appreciated the album‚Äôs release strategy as a Deluxe Edition. For the consumer, this means that the band put out the ‚Äúreal‚Äù album (12 songs), with five additional tracks. In the iTunes age, this gives the listener the opportunity to replace songs that may not be appealing with more preferable options. So if the listener only liked eight of 12 songs, the favorite tracks can be supplemented with extra songs. This gives the listener more options and helps to create a better experience. Out of the 15 songs on the Deluxe Edition, I kept 12, 10 from the standard and two from the deluxe.

Jon's brand of uplifting lyricism with spiritual overtones matches the album's music well. What separates Switchfoot from many Pop Rock outfits is the use of thoughtful, fun, and challenging lyrics. Jon is known for composing based on the writings of thinkers, philosophers, and theologians he admires (ex. Soren Kierkegaard; Dietrich Bonhoeffer). Jon‚Äôs lyrics are accessible enough for the lay poet or rock fan, but complex enough to inspire the listener to think about the deeper meaning and personal application of each song. Sometimes Jon is straight-forward in his message (‚Äúmoney gonna run away hardest / money gonna leave you broken-hearted‚Äù from Float), and other times, the words require listeners to interpret the meaning (‚Äúmy enemies weren't the ones I had fought / my liberties weren't the freedoms I had sought / what I learned weren‚Äôt the lessons I‚Äôd been taught‚Äù, from The Day I Found God). Among the serious and philosophical, are more light-hearted pieces (‚Äúbaby says she's got that feeling / Moonwalking on the ceiling‚Ä¶ baby's in that slow emotion / Moonwalking on the ocean‚Äù, from Float). 

The consistent lyrical themes throughout the album are struggle (‚Äúwhen your fear is currency / and you feel that urgency / you want peace but there's war in your head‚Äù, from I Won‚Äôt Let You Go), faith (I want more than just a crutch to lean on / yeah I'm looking for that freedom / so let's go there / to the healer of souls‚Äù, from Healer Of Souls), and healing (‚Äútake the burden from my arms / take the anchors off my lungs / take me broken and make me one / break the silence and make it a song‚Äù, from Live It Well), with the occasional topical song (America). Despite being open about struggle, many of the lyrics reflect a fight for hope (‚ÄúI wanna sing with all my heart a lifelong song / even if some notes come out right and some come out wrong‚Ä¶ I got one life and one love / I got one voice, but maybe that's enough‚Äù, from Live It Well). The centerpiece of the album, Where The Light Shines Through, brings pain, healing, and hope together in one package (‚Äúwhen you're feeling like an astronaut / stuck on a planet even time forgot / and another bottle on the shelf can't numb the pain‚Ä¶ the only tattoos I have are scars / I got your name written on my heart‚Ä¶ cause your scars shine like a dark star / yeah, your wounds are where the light shines through‚Äù). 

By comparison, WTLST sounds like a turn-of-the-century Pop Rock album. Fans who grew up in the nineties and early 2000s will recognize similar song structures and guitar tone as Switchfoot‚Äôs earlier The Beautiful Letdown, and both of Third Eye Blind‚Äôs and Tonic‚Äôs eponymous albums. Switchfoot‚Äôs brand of hopeful, thought-provoking rock is still present, but with more complex guitar, and lyrics that carry a coherent message across the entire album. For long-time Switchfoot fans, this album is a culmination of the band's past records and influences, as well as a high point of Jon‚Äôs lyrical maturity. WTLST may not have all the big hits from The Beautiful Letdown, but it is consistently better and more cohesive. 

I enjoy listening to Switchfoot on my 45-minute morning drive to work. This album‚Äôs perspective helps to get my mind ready for the day. If the listener is looking for a light-hearted album with spiritually relevant, uplifting lyrics, Where The Light Shines Through is a good choice.

168,The future of rock music [discussion],"Ok, so we all know rock music has been pretty stagnant for the past five years when it comes to development, after pop punk and emo died in 2010, indie rock (gotye, fun, foster the people, young the giant) seemed to take its place. However that lasted for three years, and the indie wave died off in 2013. Right now, I believe rock is at a crossroads, where it either has to reinvent itself, from top to bottom, or die. Let‚Äôs face it, electronic music is the future. People are sick of regular guitar production, and honestly, there‚Äôs only so many settings on an amplifier that you can toy around with to create a new sound. What do you think could happen if electronic and rock merged together? Rap and hip hop seemed to embrace electronic music with trap, but for some reason rock is still too stubborn to dive into it. I‚Äôve seen acts like 21 pilots, the 1975, (many people debate if they‚Äôre rock, but imo they are, I think people are just very elitist when it comes to accepting bands like these into the rock fold) do this successfully, but these two acts are pretty much the only rock bands in the mainstream that have done this successfully. Could there be a way to create a new sound for the electric guitar via a computer? Maybe some way to hook it up to a program that makes the notes sound somewhat electronic, kinda like what an amplifier does, but on a computer. I think this would make the genre very versatile, but I‚Äôm talking out of my ass because I know nothing about music production, so take it very lightly. On the other hand I‚Äôve seen some rock bands abandon the electric guitar completely, and head towards the bass, (21 pilots, royal blood, etc.) 
So, the question I‚Äôm asking, is what do you think could be the future of rock music. Merging with electronic music, Abandoning the electric guitar for the bass, Perhaps trading in drums for an electronic percussion pad, Let me know.",rock,1522337617,josephsong,27,7,True,2018-03-29

210,Are millennials the last generation to grow up with rock in the mainstream?,"I'm not just talking about rock music merely existing because obviously it still does, but as far as it being mainstream and having a significant cultural impact, I feel it only lasted about three generations.  Baby boomers (people born around 1946-1964) grew up with stuff like elvis, the beatles, bob dylan, and the rolling stones. Gen X (1965-1979) Grew up with AC/DC, Metallica, Prince, Michael Jackson, etc.  And lastly millenials (1980-1995) grew up with grunge/alternative and later punk/emo type stuff being in the mainstream.  The lines are kind of blurry but i feel rock died out from the mainstream somewhere in the mid to late 2000's and that rock music with Gen Z, especially the ones born after 2000, doesn't hold much significance as opposed to other genres like electronic or rap music.

Additionally I'm looking for performances that were done straight up acoustically (No electric instruments).




My personal favorites:
1. Nirvana (I'm giving them a pass for the ""effect"" during Man Who Sold the world)
2. Live (Hate to be cliche, but an underrated band and underrated acoustic performance)
3. Oasis (I think part of why I feel strongly about this is because Noel sang)

The whole point of originality is to invent that which has not be thought of, it's not linear, it's not quantifiable, it's not formulaic, which is the the point, it's out of the blue, it's inspired, it's...original! Furthermore, just because other genres have certain timescales for their prevalence does not necessitate that every genre must follow similar ones! I don't think rock's lack of popularity is inherently to do with lack of originality (though that currently is a factor) but more to do with the music industry, what it promotes and the changing cultural climate for music, where some have likened it to an expresso to be consumed on the go (a fucking disaster).

47,SURPRISING REPORT: They Might Be Giants' secret rock opera behind many major records &amp; careers [x-post from r/Music ],"Hello, music world. I have uncovered and spent several months studying a surprising experiment in storytelling and songcraft, conceived and executed by John Flansburgh and John Linnell of They Might Be Giants, dating all the way back to the end of 1981. Flansburgh and Linnell composed a lengthy, elaborate rock opera framework, and kept it a secret from fans. They have spent the time since then encouraging other artists to write songs based on the various scenes it presents, and writing their own songs based on it as well. The band has composed and recorded almost three full sets of songs, comprising nearly every song they have created, each set telling the same story - but all the songs are presented out of order and must be assembled with great patience and cleverness. (I believe the third set will be completed by whichever adult album or outtakes compilation follows I Like Fun.)

It's a shocking suggestion, and hard to believe. It is especially so when I tell you that the works which have employed the story created by They Might Be Giants include smash hits and oddities such as Alanis Morissette's album Jagged Little Pill, Goo Goo Dolls' album Dizzy Up The Girl, Death Cab For Cutie's Transatlanticism, Nobuo Uematsu's soundtrack to Final Fantasy VII and subsequent Final Fantasy vocal songs, Stephen Trask's soundtrack to the stage musical Hedwig And The Angry Inch, Music From The Adventures Of Pete &amp; Pete by Polaris (""Can you settle a sure bet? Or have you picked your dog out yet?""), and several others, all building up to create two complete sets on their own. And Prince, Barenaked Ladies, Lady Gaga, and Lorde have all either recorded or are in the process of recording their own complete versions! (Mind you, each of these collaborators composes their own music and lyrics. They Might Be Giants merely provide the framework to serve as inspiration.)

So to help the world understand, I have created an extremely lengthy and detailed report, discussing the story and characters themselves, how the rock opera was created, and how the puzzle is meant to be solved. (And I do believe it is meant to be solved: there are special clues scattered among the songs to help you build the structure and find collaborators. I'm not trying to create a scandal!) I also included a song-by-song dissection of an entire, nearly-complete set of 132 songs, one song per scene, picked and chosen from the various versions. It is color coded by speaking character and supplemented with commentary and explanation throughout. I still have some songs in the wrong places (""Government Hooker"" and ""Schei√üe"" come to mind), and the report's commentary and translation of the ""codewords"" is not 100% complete, regrettably. But I currently have no plans to perfect it or answer questions. Sorry. (EDIT: I may answer a few, on further thought, but I will not discuss me.)

It's incredibly complex and it might be difficult for many (probably most) to understand, because it requires the use of advanced logic techniques which we are taught are bad in an educational system based on standardization instead of truth and function. Perhaps the only way this will ever be proven to everyone's minds is if the artists involved come out and say I'm right. Still, I hope you find this lovingly-researched report enlightening.

Most of these songs were completely made different beasts by led zeppelin with the 'theft' mostly being lyrics. What i hate is how people downplay led zep for this, most artists did not even care for this until people went crazy for all that, the credits been given to most people. What i want to emphasize is the fact that led zeppelin, in 1968, were not some evil guys stealing stuff, to their mind it was just inspiration, something at that time, especially in the blues was quite rampant, its like doing you doing something  quite normal and realizing that 50 years later, it is looked down upon. And talking about inspiration, why not sue every metal band for the galloping-style first used by Achilles Last Stand?, why not sue Punk bands for taking Page's Downpicking technique and evolving it into punk rock.

144,Band promotion: Neptune,"**Hello fellow rockers!**

I hope that the following incredible story will suit you well.

Neptune is one of the first hard rock, heavy metal bands from Sweden and was formed back in 1979 at the early days of hard rock, heavy metal and still today all 5 original members remain in the band. Only difference is that lead guitarist Andy Olsson came into the band 1985.

Neptune worked long with their debut album in the mid 80's. Several record companies showed great interest and the album were only signatures away from being released on both vinyl and CD. Unfortunately, that dint happened and the album ended up in the freezer for almost 30 years.

""Neptune is widely considered by most heavy metal gurus as one of the best unsigned Epic Metal bands from Sweden in the 80's. With an image and song writing style like a cross between IRON MAIDEN, HEAVY LOAD and MANOWAR, the band penned some great classic heavy metal tunes and managed to gain a cult status among demo collectors and underground metal fans around the globe""

And 30 years apart, Neptune is now back!  Armed with with a new record deal, the album will be entitled ""Land of Northern"" it will be a fantastic 16 page limited special edition, featuring remastered sound, song lyrics, band photos and story and original fantasy cover artwork. To be released in Feb/Mars 2018 by Sonic Age Records. What's happened to this band is more or less unbelievable. For how many band can be apart this long and still has the urge to play again, with heart and soul?

A special thanks goes to Narnia/Christian Liljegren and the Swedish metal guitar wizard Janne Stark, who has worked relentless to make this record deal possible.

Sonic Age Records have now made a recording deal with the band and agreed to reissue their 13 classic songs on vinyl and CD, with the CD version estimated to come out by February of 2018.

I used to hear 80 Rock,Punk Rock etc when I was arround 14-16. When I turned 17 I started to hear other Music like German Rap and Trap. I noticed in the last few months that I started to get depressed and beeing on edge all the time. I had and have a lot of stress with my graduation coming closer and closer that also effected my mental state quite a lot but I used to have fights with my parents and having stress all the time back then too. The thing that changed was the music I started hearing. I noticed a few days back while listening to some songs I haven't heard that much back than, that my overall state of mind became more positive and sain. So I think listining to rock really helps me cope with my stress and family. It's just that I heard so much Punk,Indie and Rock that I really can't find anything new.
I despretly need recommendations.
Right now I'm hearing Appeal to Reason by Rise against all the time and I'd love to hear things in this direction.

191,"'68 Craft Hard Sounds On ""Two Parts Viper"" (Review) (OC) (Originally Posted On r/Music)","Two Parts Viper is a great follow-up record that matches the quality of ‚Äò68‚Äôs first, In Humor and Sadness. Fans of the Chariot and In Utero-era Nirvana will be pleased with this effort.

Much of the album can be described as ‚Äúpositive aggression‚Äù. Vocalist Josh Scogin sings with the late Kurt Cobain‚Äôs howls, but without the angst. He sounds like he‚Äôs having a good time, yelping, whooping, and using accents (No Apologies) throughout the record. The vocals give the feeling that the listener is part of a hard rock party. Songs frequently take unexpected turns, like using a repeating delay effect on vocals (Whether Terrified of Unafraid), or abrupt changes in tempo (riff-silence-explosive drumming-abrasive guitars). Many of the tracks have catchy guitar parts and vocal phrases (Death Is a Lottery). The album also has a do-it-yourself ethic reminiscent of In Utero.

The lyrics express affirmation (‚ÄúI could have been anyone from anywhere, but I chose to be myself right here‚Äù ‚Äì on Whether Terrified or Unafraid), sorrow (‚Äúthe saddest songs that I wrote are how I wish you were here‚Äù - Without Any Words), and reflection (‚Äúdeath is quick but it can last so long‚Äù - Death Is a Lottery). The lyrics are open to interpretation, with a little guidance hidden in the verses and titles. The lyrics of Without Words might be a Kurt Cobain reference; the title of The Workers are Few is a Biblical reference. I particularly enjoyed the phrase ‚Äúafter the sticks click‚Äù from What More Can I Say as a possible reference to death using an analogy of drum sticks clicking.

Two Parts Viper is as good as In Humor and Sadness, or any of The Chariot‚Äôs last three studio albums. It is a unique record that is difficult to categorize ‚Äì like The Chariot with more jams, less distorted guitars, and a more relaxed feel. The album could be classified as Indie Rock, Hard Rock, or Metal.

Two Parts Viper is innovative. It is nice to hear a record that is not a rehash of past albums, or a pastiche of worn-out older styles.

88,New Sub For Bedroom Musicians To Collaborate,"Hello,

After collaborating with some overseas friends on a project (a Metallica Orion cover - I'm the bassist) I had an idea.

Many musicians have time constraints that prevent us playing in local bands, but have the gear and know-how to record ourselves. 

So how cool would if be to create an environment where bedroom artists can share ideas, talk about their projects and, most importantly, collaborate?

So I set up a new subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/BedroomBands/

I've posted in several subs whose members I believe will appreciate the concept. These posts have been well received, so now I'm posting in a few more places too.

I know spam is annoying. So I hope this isn't seen as a spam post. I just really think this is a cool idea and it will only work if the community grows to a decent size. I'll monitor these posts - if they get downvoted or annoy people, I'll promote the sub in a different way.

Soooo...if this is something that appeals to you, please subscribe to the sub and post away.

For artists looking to collaborate, feel free to post a video or recording of yourself playing, or just an idea that you hope gets picked up.

If this thing works, it will be a place to go when you think - ""damn, this song is cool, but it needs some saxophone"" (or guitar, or piano, or harp, or whatever). And how cool would it be to have a place like that?!

59,[Question] what's that genre of rock that has guitar riffs where the melody puts you in a trance state of 'being lost' just to be suddenly awakened by the chorus?,"I'm trying to find a genre type or a group of words to reference a genre of rock, where the tune or melody played has almost a type of trance-like feel, where the listener wearing a headset while hiking in the woods would definitely get lost if he is too focused on the melody for a long period of time...or a mechanic/guy on a motorbike would get into this 'flow state' where past and present doesn't exist but the 'here and now' happens without even cognitively thinking about his actions

The verses sung could be anything that drones into the rhythm. And then when the chorus hits, the sharp contrast of a loud and catchy melodic message in a hook is belted in a very strikingly clear manner for the listener to gain a very brief instance of ""I'm awake""...and then the droning melody comes back after the chorus and the song fades back into oblivion/cloudiness/sense of forgetfulness/a dream-like trance for the listener to patiently wait for the chorus to come back....this contrast between awake and cloudiness is a roller coaster ride for the brain's senses and these songs (if it has the right melody and message) usually initially gets played like 100 times before the user gets enough of the song

Last year, I set out on a quest to find music like PF and explored as many as 16 discographies from various Prog Rock bands as I could find. Camel was one of them and some of their songs stroke close to heart and I have been in love with them ever since. Last week, I reset out on another quest trying to find out songs similar to the ones below but I am falling short. I simply cannot believe that songs like these are short-lived!

I will provide as many examples as possible to help you in assisting me.

191,Rock musical issues,"I'm being stalked by Kirk hammett of Metallica he is a sick evil pos he has spent months abusing and tormenting me and ruining my life he has no soul and is twisted and sick. He is an evil pos and is the worst. He tortures me daily through witchcraft and is a terrible person and he wont stop. At first he was nice then he got psychotic and Is now obsessed with torturing me badly. He has no soul and does the most awful horrific things to me it is some of the worst torture a person can go through. At first he acted like he liked me but his abuse and control got worse. The Metallica tuning room song ""you're a d* ck"" is what I would write to Kirk and use the asterisk and they made a song about it. Also I'm the one being stalked by this predator whos a witch. And there are other people who've been victimized by him as well. He also says he owns me. Kirk is the devil and the worst person anyone could ever deal with. He also seems to think torturing me is funny. He's mentally ill and has a lot of serious issues and was abused badly as a child. It seems he's forcing me to go thru the torture he went thru and it is some really bad shit. He even says if I want to be a part of him I have to experience what he did- huh?? I never chose to be any part of this and I didnt even know who he was.. I feel sorry for his victims bc I've never met anyone as fucked up as him. He is def the sickest person ive ever encountered in my life and so messed up. Almost all his Facebook posts are about what we talk about. He also says things in interviews that we talk about. His post game face was when he got psycho and began playing the sickest games with me.  His latest one has to do with me asking him why he can't be normal like he was in the past and during the time they were in Europe was when he was normal. Kirk is really obsessive- but before he was nice. Now he's just really psycho. Its obvious he's just mentally sick and sick in so many ways. He mentally tortures me like literally 24/7- the only time he doesn't is when I'm sleeping, or when they have concerts, then he doesn't have time. The in between periods he is so sick..I wish he'd stop doing this to me...I miss the time when he was nice...I hate metallica- at first it was two band members doing this- the other one wasn't bad at all then somehow he handed it to KIRK and kirk is now terrorizing me. However, the other one may still be involved in the background. They still try to say that metallica owns me and kirk says he owns me. I hate these people- they have done the worst sh*t to me- no human deserves to go through the horror i've been through. I dont know if this is some sick game it probably is but they both are laughing about it. I dont know wtf this is or what is going on...psycho kirk even stopped me from evacuating from hurricane irma, and he does thru his stupid witch metaphysical abilities...its crazy sh* t and at first- it wasn't bad but now it's like, another level.. thats not to take the blame off kirk- i dont know who really is behind this...if its both of them or just kirk..the other one is 'james' but i dont know to what extent he's involved. I'm also not allowed to expose him but im sick of this crap. These stupid celebrities are witches, most of them or into this crap and the occult...these jerks stalk me psychically and know everything about me- all my thoughts, everything i do- every freaking thing. They know every detail about me i can't even describe it. then they began stalking my family members too and tormenting me with it- won't get into all the sick crap...it's crazy and some kind of sick joke. You can't get rid of them b/c it's mostly through witchcraft. It's the craziest most surreal nonsense to exist..there are def other victims out there...

This is all long distance through crazy ways. I've heard there are other victims. He spends all his time tormenting his victims.  I can't stop him. I don't know why he's doing this to me. I pray he rots in hell he is the lowest form of rotten scum on the planet. He's a horrible terrible person and claims he's madly in love with me and has to break me and keep me down that's why he's doing this. He has done awful sick things to me. He's so sick and evil. I don't buy it. He's just a sick evil sadist who now wants to make me suffer. He says he's never going to stop. There's nothing I can do I'm screwed. He also mind controls me.  I can't get into how sick he is and he has me in lots of psychic connections so he can mentally torture me all the time. He is the worst person to exist. He's some out of control maniac. His levels of torture and abuse are really extreme and it's not just mental can't get into the horrendous things he has done to me. He also wants me writing abotu this crap online- like he wants to get attention for the awful stuff he's doing to me. They said I was their puppet, but now it's just gotten really bad. I'm exhausted and disgusted from all the hell i've had to go through. There's a reason Kirk is into horror. It's not just an interest. He also does horrific things to me then thru fucked up mind control makes me post it here. Horrific. Sickest shit u can't imagine. He's like inside of me or we're meshed in this satanic crap. It's so fucking sick I just hope someone punches the crap out of him. Kirk is the sickest person to exist and im fucked. Trust me I'm not lucky to be getting stalked by these sociopaths. They are like demons. It's stuff they can destroy a person. It's like satanic cultic abuse or worse.

I wanted to share with you a compilation that has been put together to help with my medical costs. I have been disabled now for almost a year due to hyperadrenergic postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome as well as autoimmune encephalitis. This has led to countless treatments (one in particular costing 20k!) and many bands have come together to support me with a 31 track compilation. I wanted to share this here as I think many have not seen or heard of the compilation and may really enjoy it.

If you like it and want to spread the word through sharing it or whatever you see fit that would be amazing. If you would consider purchasing the compilation, that would be even better! If not, no worries. You checking it out means a lot. In that case let me know which tracks you like if you have the time.

Thank you so much for reading this and I have placed the Bandcamp link below with a list of all 31 tracks.

Sometimes people put bands that some consider metal while others don't, while others put albums that are ""heavy"" more lyrically than sonically.

Aren't we all? The great part about this is everyone is right (unless you put a legitimately metal album). Oh, and yes, Kyuss are in the metal archives (I know, it bums me out too I can't put them in my list). Let the heaviness commence.

1. Big Black - Songs About F-ing
2. Swans - Children of God
3. Nine Inch Nails - Downward Spiral
4. Tool - Aenima
5. QOTSA - SFTD

Usually I just flip through radio stations, but I found the local rock station and really liked some of the songs. Unfortunately, I'm a total newbie to this genre (classical musician, never really was exposed to it as a kid or teen) and it's such a big genre that I don't really know where to start! 

I know I like the more melodic pieces over the harsher screaming pieces, but I love me some heavy instrumental breaks as well! Some pieces in particular I like are the stuff Linkin Park wrote for Transformers (What I've Done, New Divide, Iridescent).

64,"Please, spread my letter, I want Foo Fighters to see it! Thank you!","This is an open letter to the band Foo Fighters.

I am writing this because I have a great desire to hear you play a song, that I cherish deeply in my heart. I am sitting at my desk next to my ticket to your gig at Budapest and hoping, that you will get this letter and hear me out.

I have one request from you: please, play Comeback. I know it is not the most beloved, nor the biggest hit of yours, but it was the biggest for me. When Pretender became a hit song, I asked my elder brothers to show me more Foo Fighters songs, but they could not do it. So I started do dig, and I found an album titled One by One. I fell in love with it, because it was a hard time for me and for my family too. The last song of it, Comeback got me through those days, and every time I  fucked up something, I always hummed that song. I know it is not about exactly about trying again and keep fighting, but due to my lack of English knowledge, it meant me that. I will come back, I will try and I won't give up.

It had another effect on my life: I showed this song to my brothers, and they loved it! It was the first time, that I showed them a song and not them showed me. It inspired me to search for more. I listened back to forth all of your albums, and when Wasting Light came out, I already had a Foo T-shirt (a terrible one) and a guitar, on what I only knew two riffs: the beginning of comeback, and the beginning of simple man from Lynyrd Skynyrd. This song made me search for more, to find new things and to be open minded about things that I haven't met yet. This is why now I know so many other bands, that I have so many good memories and a relationship. I left the fears of mine, and tried new things and found, after all, happiness (and also became a huge rock & roll fan).

This song helped me survive, made me amaze my brothers who are my best friends, inspired me to start playing the guitar and try new things. Comeback ignited the good parts of my life, and I will be forever in your dept. 
This is my one and only chance to hear you play it, so please, Gods of my ears, play this kick-ass song for the sake of your biggest fan.
With a rock & roll filled, beating heart,

THING IS, I do love Rock, but I don't have the same rock ""culture"" as she has and she kinda gave me a list of all the classics she loves to listen and want me to do the same. I want to lie about my taste in music and give her examples of songs that she might appreciate as well so we can have things to speak about. Can you help me out ? Here's the list she sent me 

les cure - close to me , inbetween days, friday i'm in love 
les strokes - the end has no end, reptilia, automatic stop, one way trigger 
radiohead - creep , thinking about you, paranoid android
les red hot - snow, californication, scar tissue, can't stop
bowie - rock n roll suicide, heroes, life on mars ?, ashes to ashes
stuck in the sound - silent & sweet 
beach boys - wouldn't it be nice, i get around
nirvana - the man who sold the world & where did you sleep last night
les pixies - where is my mind

62,Anyone know any songs similar to Arabella by Arctic Monkeys?,"Yeah so bit of a sob story but I find it hard to listen to Arabella by the arctic monkeys (and their songs overall for that matter) because my dad died very shortly before I discovered the band. It's my favourite song of all time and yet I ironically cannot listen to it without a deep feeling of regret and anxiety. Basically I've spent the last 3 years looking for songs that have that sort of smooth build up and nice riffs etc. and it was probably the whole reason I got into rock in the first place (found some amazing songs while searching) so basically if anyone knows any similar tracks or styled artists it'd be much appreciated.

TL:DR. Family tragedy means I can't listen to arctic monkeys. Would love to know some similarly styled artists.

108,"Need help finding a genre that sounds like the 70's/early 80's classic rock but is melow like ""Brother's in Arms"" kind of thing.","Oops. Wrong context. Fixed

I am a fan of classical rock music, mainly 1980's, and it involves a wide range of rock. But there are songs that I hear here and there in movies, online, and it gives me peace. These such songs are from a genre of rock that I don't really know because they are not my go-to type of songs that I listen to. They are songs that I listen to when the occasion arises, such as winding down after a busy day or when I want to become happy. They are not fast-paced like Dire Strait's  Walk of Life, but includes the bells and whistles of a typical 1970's rock melow genre. 

I have been in pursuit of this genre by myself for 6 years now. I know. Crazy. It happens when you don't have a direction and don't know where to look. 

Maybe I am thinking of Blues or Pub Rock, but I don't know. They include the electric guitar. 

2 such songs in my head are:

Dire Strait's Brothers in Arms

Pink Floyd's Shine on you crazy diamond (the original, not the delicate sound of thunder)

I don't care that it is old, I don't care that it is modern. What I don't want is the sound of clapping, snapping and all that. 

You know what they make you feel like? It makes you feel calm and have a peace of mind. It makes you feel like a Vietnam era grunt sitting behind a .50 Cal in a Huey on a Patrol staring into the beautiful Sunset with a cigar in his mouth contemplating the death of his compatriot and the difficult life choice that he has made and wishing it could all just end, while enjoying the breezy ride over the rice paddies of Da Nang.",rock,1489298784,negativevotes-,6,3,True,2017-03-12

128,Nickelback is my guilty pleasure,"Hi guys,
I have a confession. Nickelback is my guilty pleasure. Let me explain.

I hate everything nickelback shows us, everything about them sounds calculated, formulated and created by massive studios to just reach the largest audience possible. There are a lot of bands like this which 'sound like rock music' but lack the fundamental flair and feel that gives great rock the feeling of rock. They represent an industry focused on money over creativity, I can't stand them. The problem isn't that they are bad, sonically they are average. They don't really do anything wrong, but they never do anything great. They just produce catchy vague music, the fact that they have pop appeal isn't my problem but rather that it feels so intentionally created to be average in every facet. They rarely go for a really soft rock, or really hard rock song, it's all right in the centre with pretty cliche and vague themes. It doesn't feel like there is any passion for their music or the art of rock. Again I don't think they sound bad, or good they are just average, but so successful and clearly industrially created and pushed for large market appeal. If all they did was sound average, make cliche songs but had a clear passion for what they were doing and were evolving as years went by, even if there evolution was them getting worse, then I wouldn't mind them too much. It's the fact that it's so engineered and so pushed by the industry that frustrates me.

The problem is I can't get enough of them, with everything I said above taken into account I for some inexplicable reason love listening to their music which is a very strange sensation. There isn't really much point to this post I just wanted to confess my biggest guilty pleasure.

Personally I am a big fan of bands such as Rush, Queen, The Who, and Pink Floyd.  In creating this I mean to comment on the psychedelic style of Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd (really noticeable in Astronomy Domine and See Emily Play) and how similar it is to the later efforts by The Beatles, particularly *Sgt Pepper's* and *Magical Mystery Tour*.  This also parallels The Who, who I feel wrote an ""early Beatles"" song in The Kids Are Alright.  Both bands of course took from these two eras then moved into their own directions separate from almost any other band I know of.

I only know that David Bowie voiced LRH in the Altlantis episode of Spongebob. As musicians, I feel like rock artists seem to have a skeptical view on the entertainment industry as a whole, specifically on-screen acting, or they feel that they'll be entering 'sell-out' territory if they get asked to voice a character in a Pixar movie. I know what I'm asking here sounds kind of dumb, but rock is my favorite genre and I'm an animation fan/enthusiast as well, so it's kind of disheartening to not see/ hear about my favorite band members voicing a glipglop or duck.

120,The 5 most written about rock acts of 2016,"2016 was another huge year in the world of rock music. We saw chart topping new albums from Metallica, Green Day, and RHCP. Guns N‚Äô Roses ended a decade of fighting to reform and tour with their classic line-up. And Iggy Pop surprised us by joining forces with Josh Homme of QOTSA to release the delightful ‚ÄòPost Pop Depression‚Äô. 

¬†

So who stole the most headlines this year? Who did the press gush over? As a music curation site [MuzeRoom](http://www.muzeroom.com) knows which blogs and publications covered which artists. So from the millions of articles published in 2016, we‚Äôve compiled a list of the 5 rocks acts that were written about the most.

¬†

**[5. Green Day](http://www.muzeroom.com/artists/green-day)**
Green Day were all over the web throughout 2016, most notably with the release of their 12th studio album ‚ÄòRevolution Radio‚Äô. They stunned the crowd at the American Music Awards by getting political and starting an anti Trump chant.  And Billie Joe Armstrong starred as an aging punk rocker (aka himself?!) in the rather forgettable feature film ‚ÄúOrdinary World‚Äù. 

¬†

**[4. AC/DC](http://www.muzeroom.com/artists/ac-dc)**
It wasn‚Äôt a great start to the year for AC/DC, with singer Brian Johnson ordered by doctors in March to stop touring or face permanent hearing loss. But in a move that shocked the rock world, he was replaced by Guns 'n Roses frontman Axl Rose for the band's 'Rock Or Bust' world tour. It went down well with fans, and the tour secured the band #7 on the Forbes highest paid musicians list for 2016 with $67.5 million in earnings. 

¬†

**[3. Deftones](http://www.muzeroom.com/artists/deftones)**
It was a strong year for the Deftones as they released their 8th studio album ‚ÄúGore‚Äù, the band's highest charting release since 2003. Chino Moreno formed yet another new group called Saudade with members of Bad Brains and Cro-Mags. Fans celebrated 10 years since the release of ‚ÄúSaturday Night Wrist‚Äù, but Chino publicly slated the album, calling it ‚Äòfragmented‚Äô. And in what seems to be a trend these days, the band announced the release of their own beer called ‚ÄúPhantom Bride IPA‚Äù. Cheers! 

¬†

**[2. Slipknot](http://www.muzeroom.com/artists/slipknot)**
It‚Äôs been 2 years since Slipknot‚Äôs last record ‚Äú.5: The Gray Chapter‚Äù, but despite no new record to promote, there was still a lot to write about. Corey Taylor got all anti-trump, threw several fans out of shows, and got in a spat with Deicide‚Äôs Glen Benton. And finally, it could be a long wait for the next Slipknot record, with the band stating it was unlikely they would enter the studio for another 2 years. 

¬†

**[1. Metallica](http://www.muzeroom.com/artists/metallica)**
Without doubt though, 2016 has to be the year of Metallica. The band returned to deliver their first new music in 10 years, the blistering new album ‚ÄòHardwired... to Self-Destruct‚Äô. Not content with just an album, the band decided to release music videos for each of their 12 new songs.  They were nominated for another grammy, with ‚ÄòHardwired‚Äô up for best rock song. And who could forget them joining Jimmy Fallon and The Roots to play Enter Sandman on kids instruments?!

¬†

So there you have it - the 5 most written about rock acts of 2016. What were your highlights?

61,The Complete Official Velvet Underground Discography (X-post from r/velvetunderground),"I have been struggling to find all of the songs released officially by my favorite band, and I'm hoping that this community might be able to help me out. It's very frustrating to sort through all of the different editions of Velvet Underground albums that have been released on the years. There are so many live recordings that are repeatedly included on box sets like ""Peel Slowly and See"" or ""The Velvet Underground & Nico 45th Anniversary Super Deluxe Edition"" that I just can‚Äôt keep track of them all. Below, I have a list of albums that I‚Äôve considered downloading to complete my collection. I‚Äôm hoping to eventually form a list of albums that, when put together, will give me the most complete official discography of the Velvet Underground that I can possibly have with as few duplicate tracks as possible. If you could help me I would appreciate it immensely.

So far, I've found that:
- The Velvet Underground & Nico 45th Anniversary Super Deluxe Edition is considered the definitive edition of the band‚Äôs first album. It includes Chelsea Girls, a Nico album featuring members of the Velvet Underground. I think it also has some live recordings on it that haven‚Äôt been officially released anywhere else.
- White Light/White Heat 45th Anniversary Deluxe Edition includes a previously unreleased live performance by the band in addition to some different mono mixes and demos that may be exclusive to this release. It's considered to be the album‚Äôs definitive edition.
- The Velvet Underground 45th Anniversary Super Deluxe Edition is considered the definitive edition of the band‚Äôs third album. It includes an exclusive live performance at the Matrix and both released mixes of the album (Closet and Valentin).
- Loaded: Re-Loaded 45th Anniversary Reissue has a lot of exclusive tracks and an exclusive live performance, but also contains Live at Max‚Äôs, Kansas City except for tracks 8 and 9. Do I need to just download those 2 tracks separately if I want them? I don‚Äôt want 2 copies of the whole album!
- La Cave 1968 is a live recording with John Cale. It‚Äôs an official release of material that has appeared on a lot of bootlegs. Are there other bootlegs that I don‚Äôt mention on this list that have been officially released?
- The Velvet Underground: The Complete Matrix Tapes apparently contains better recordings of all the tracks on 1969: The Velvet Underground Live, as I mentioned in my first paragraph, in addition to some new recordings that can‚Äôt be found anywhere else.
- Bootleg Series, Volume 1: The Quine Tapes looks like its own release. I‚Äôm not sure if the tracks on it can be found on other compilations.
- I have Squeeze and I‚Äôm debating getting Final V.U. 1971-1973. I‚Äôm sort of afraid to listen to the Velvet Underground without Lou Reed because I‚Äôve heard bad things about it, but I want to give Doug Yule a chance at least. I also am a completist and would like to say that I have all of the Velvet Underground recordings.
- Live MCMXCIII, Another View, and VU are all in my music library already.
- My biggest issue is with the Peel Slowly and See box set. This includes a lot of exclusive tracks, but it also has the first 4 Velvet Underground albums and some tracks from VU and Another View. If I were to get this whole album, I‚Äôd have a LOT of duplicates. What tracks on it don‚Äôt appear on any other Velvet Underground albums on my list?
- There was a book called Andy Warhol‚Äôs Index that included a track of Nico talking while the band played in the background. I‚Äôve been considering downloading this one track since the book is technically an official release‚Ä¶
- There are existing recordings of songs by bands like the Primitives out there, but I‚Äôm not sure what the best way would be to get them. Have there been official releases of songs like ‚ÄúThe Ostrich‚Äù, or do they only appear on bootlegs? In any case, how can I find these? I‚Äôd love to be able to listen to the 1st demos for Heroin as well...

TL;DR - What albums/tracks would I need to obtain in order to get all of the Velvet Underground's officially released music with as few duplicate tracks as possible?",rock,1478401167,BobTheEgg,0,3,True,2016-11-05

23,Lollapalooza 2016 and KOL.,"Hi everybody! So the festival season is officially closed for me and my summer 2016 ended up with a mega-cool festival Lollapalooza in Berlin. My luggage is at home, photos in my netbook and I‚Äôm ready to tell you how it was.
I start with Kings of Leon‚Äôs performance on September 10, 2016. Our love story began in far 2008, when an album ‚ÄúOnly by the Night‚Äù and the legendary ‚ÄúSex on Fire‚Äù saw the light. My love to them is strange, like addiction, very strong and irresistible. Songs of these ‚Äúdirty sweaty men‚Äù make something unimaginable to me. And their concerts are passing all beliefs. You can either love or hate them. Some say that they are too posh, self-indulgent and overestimated. But I haven‚Äôt seen anywhere soooooo many people as on their concerts. I should confess that even crowd-jams on a concert of 30 Seconds to Mars is just baby-talk in comparison to my first concert of KOL.
3 concerts are behind but I continue to repeat that KOL is one love! 
So as for the Lolla 2016 at Berlin. KOL was Saturday‚Äôs headliners. It was a big crowd there, you could hardly move. I was very delighted with people there, who came not just for ‚Äúblabbing‚Äù. People really came for the concert and to enjoy music and dance till night.
KOL played their ‚Äúgold‚Äù set-list, which do not differ very much from the last Sziget. The performance was diluted with a new composition ‚ÄúWaste a Moment‚Äù from the future album, and also a small lyrical digression when Caleb greeted a happy birthday to his brother and solo-guitarist Matthew, presented him a balloon in the shape of a guitar and sang with the audience ‚ÄúHappy Birthday to You‚Äù.
As for the rest, it was a traditional concert of KOL with the final ‚ÄúSex on Fire‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure that I will visit many concerts and festivals with Kings of Leon, because they are ONE LOVE 4EVER!

99,Rock and Roll Hall of fame 2017. Artist Predictions and Discussion.,"Hello everyone, as you all may or may not be aware, the 2017 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Ballot is being released with this year's nominees on October 18th.  

That is just over a week away, isn't it exciting.

Now, last year we finally got to see Deep Purple, Cheap Trick, and Chicago finally join the Hall after years of being snubbed, so I can only hope that some amazing artists will finally make it in this year. Whether from being snubbed as well or from finally being eligible this year.

So, let's try and predict who will be in this year.

Now, the list of this year's eligibles are pretty outstanding. Being led by Pearl Jam, 2Pac, The Cranberries, and Cypress Hill. Plus one of my all time favorites, The Prodigy. (Though I know they probably won't be nominated)

The full list of the artists eligible this year are as follows

**2 Unlimited,¬†2Pac,¬†Alanis Morissette,Antestor,¬†Aphex Twin,¬†At the Gates,¬†Bikini Kill,Boyz II Men,¬†Brooks and Dunn,¬†Catherine Wheel,Chris Whitley,¬†Color Me Badd,¬†Cornershop,¬†The Cranberries,¬†Crash Test Dummies,¬†Crystal Waters,¬†Curtis Stigers,¬†Cypress Hill,¬†Deceased,DJ Quik,¬†Earth,¬†EMF,¬†The Frames,¬†Frankie Knuckles,GZA,¬†Helmet,¬†Joan Osbourne,¬†Kyuss,¬†Letters to Cleo,¬†LFO,¬†Lisa Germano,¬†Live,¬†The Magnetic Fields,¬†Marc Cohn,¬†Marilyn McCoo,¬†Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch,¬†Mercury Rev,¬†Meshuggah,¬†Mint Condition,¬†Moe.,¬†Moose,¬†My Dying Bride,¬†Naughty By Nature,¬†Paul Gilbert,¬†Paul Weller,¬†Pearl Jam,¬†PJ Harvey,¬†PM Dawn,¬†The Prodigy, Ricky Martin,¬†Right Said Fred,¬†Rocket from the Crypt,¬†Saigon Kick,¬†Seal,¬†Skyclad,¬†Sleep,¬†Spin Doctors,¬†Stereolab,¬†Tara Kemp,¬†Teddybears,Temple of the Dog,¬†Therion,¬†Tori Amos,¬†Type O Negative,¬†Ugly Kid Joe,¬†Wayne Kramer**

Now, all of these bands are deserving, but I wouldn't be surprised if only 2 or 3 of them get in this year. If that.

Now, if we look at last year's nominees we can maybe get a glimpse of who else might be added as well. 

With Chic being on the ballot for the 11th time in a row, as well as Nine Inch Nails being snubbed for the 2nd time.  As well as Janet Jackson, Yes, The Cars, and The Spinners. Plus a few more I can't remember.

Then finally we have to factor in the artists who have been snubbed for God knows how long. Like The Cure, Def Leopard, Journey, Ozzy (As a Solo Artist) and Mot√∂rhead. Who, in my opinion (especially after Lemmy's recent death) Definitely deserves to finally be on the ballot. 

By the way, all the names i just mentioned, have been ready for 10 or more years, and all of them have never even been on a single ballot.

I could sit here all day and name names who should be included that should be included that have been snubbed, but it would be way too long.

So, after going over all of this I have composed at least my list for the nominees this year. Which, will be 16 artists/bands. (Same as last year) 

My List:

**Mot√∂rhead
Pearl Jam
Journey
The Cranberries
Yes
The Cars
Janet Jackson
Def Leopard
Chic
2Pac
The Spinners
Ozzy Osbourne 
Cypress Hill
Jane's Addiction
The Cure
Depeche Mode**


That is my list. There are so many Artists out there deserving of a nomination. Let me know down below who your picks are. I know I've probably missed some.

Also, are you guys looking forward to the Ceremony this year? Are any of you going? Comment and let me know your thoughts.

Anyway, That's all I've gotta say. Ciao.

110,The Mixtape Project,"Hey everyone!

With the most common form of music today being digital, the art of the mixtape, whether it be on CD or an actual cassette tape, has been fading away.

However, we have decided to start a project to bring together and collect a wide variety of ""mixtapes"" made by people around the world, showcasing all different genres of music and the artwork that people take the time to create on both the cases and CD/tape.

The idea is fairly simple. We are starting to collect people's mixtapes now by mail, and we will slowly start posting images and write-ups (on a few different places) of every one that we receive. We will also provide a track listing and any other info we receive. We hope that this project will not only showcase the different artistic styles of people around the world, but also get people to put the time into making the mixtape (which used to be a popular hobby) and open up a new forum for discussions about music! Eventually, we plan on setting up a mixtape exchange so mixes can be shared with other contributors!

Some guidelines for the mixtapes are:

-Has to be an actual mixtape made for this project, so no store-bought, pre-recorded CDs/tapes, and must be a variety of music (not just all one artist). There is no restrictions when picking the tracks so make it one that you would actually want to listen to yourself!

-Must have a track listing included somewhere (whether it be on the actual case or a separate piece of paper)

-Feel free to make the case and CD/tape as artistic as you want

-OPTIONAL: Feel free to include a write up/descriptions on why you chose certain tracks and/or what they mean to you, on a separate piece of paper with the CD/tape

-OPTIONAL: You can also include any personal social media usernames and/or websites so that people can get in touch with you if they want to talk music!

If you are interested in participating, leave a comment and we will get in touch with you with further details and an address that you can send your mix to!

Thanks and happy mixing!",rock,1476155354,themixtapeproject,2,5,True,2016-10-10

53,Anyone else tired of indie bands?,"Before you say ""Well they're independent"" thats not what i'm particularly talking about. There are tons of bands that are indie in that way but there are 2 types of indie rock 

1 = Independent Rock (meaning its a rock band that may be on a small label or do home recordings) 

2 = Indie Rock (Which has its own sound) 

I think stuff that Mac Demarco makes is great, he is a great example of an Indie band that most people can actually listen to and enjoy. 

But then there is stuff like Cage The Elephant that really bugs the shit out of me. Like these guys have like 11,300,000 Views and all they're doing is copying other bands. Like I legitimately don't understand how this sound was brought up. 

Literally every record label I see I always see that one band that tries too way hard to have that Indie Hipster look. 

I don't hate them for it. But I wish these types of bands would work on their sound more then their fucking look. 

Maybe I'm the only one who feels this way. Anyone else agree or am I alone on this one? ",rock,1472705764,[deleted],4,11,True,2016-09-01

89,"I'm curious, how many know about Michael Monroe, Andy McCoy, Sami Yaffa and Hanoi Rocks?","So Michael Monroe was the vocalist, Andy McCoy the guitarist and Sami Yaffa the bassist in the band [Hanoi Rocks](https://youtu.be/G9qHE9P8tHE) (1979-1985, 2001-2009) (there were others too, but these guys are still active), and in Finland they are hailed as rock heroes. There are non greater. Almost always when rock legends visit Finland, like [Slash](https://youtu.be/GN45uDMLDMU), [Alice Cooper](https://youtu.be/pqROIrAPnn4) or [Lemmy Kilmister](https://youtu.be/6vGfSVx8T3A)(R.I.P.), you can almost be certain that at least Mike Monroe will join them on stage at some point 'cause they all know him. Some argue that [Guns n Roses](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304587704577333813382925678) would not have been the same band if it wasn't for Hanoi Rocks, who they hang out with a lot during the 80's. 

That's why I'm a bit bummed when it seems that many rockers are unaware of them. Michael Monroe and his band released three very rockin' albums - Sensory Overdrive (2011), Horns and Halos (2013), Blackout States (2015) - but I feel they have not got the traction I think they deserve. Classic Rock Magazine did choose Sensory Overdrive as Rock Album of the Year in 2011, but these awards don't seem to matter much anymore.

So if you are a rocker and you haven't really been aware of anything I just wrote about, I warmly recommend to you mr Michael Monroe. Do check him out. If it's not your thing, toss it out.  But if it is your thing, I'm happy for you.

You can start by listening to Mike Monroe reminisce his years in New York City in [The Ballad of Lower East Side](https://youtu.be/XhAbtZXu2RU).",rock,1473414354,CrejCrej,6,4,True,2016-09-09

That being said, it seems like just as many, if not more, dislike or even dispise their two most recent albums, especially Unleashed

I mean I love both Comatose and Awake, but I thought Rise was pretty good and Unleashed seems okay to me. Is it because of the heavy emphasis on Electronic? Is it nostalgia? What's the reason? Yes, Rise and Unleashed had some pretty bad songs, but they also had some great songs. Same thing with Awake and Comatose (Better than Drugs and Sometimes were both mediocre, the rest are fantastic).

27,"Penny Mob ready to revitalise UK indie, starting with double A-side ‚ÄòMr Generation‚Äô and ‚ÄòWar on the Streets‚Äô","Excellent twin release due to make an impact on May 2nd

London three piece with energy to burn, Penny Mob, are a band who feed off bands who‚Äôve inspired them and the pure exuberance of youth. Likened to the greats of British Indie such as The Kinks, Oasis, Cast, The Clash, Arctic Monkeys, The Sex Pistols and more, they are very quickly winning fans in the music and entertainment industry.

When a band can count Amazing Radio tastemaker Jim Gellatly among their fans, then that‚Äôs a sign that they are onto a good thing. The momentum is only set to increase with the release of double A-side single ‚ÄòMr Generation‚Äô and ‚ÄòWar on the Streets‚Äô.

There are further plans ahead to release an EP and singles in the spring and summer. In the meantime, the tracks below give a solid indication of the quality that will be on offer.

Mr Generation: https://soundcloud.com/pennymob/mr-generation
War on the Streets: https://soundcloud.com/pennymob/war-on-the-streets

The band are no strangers to the oddness of the entertainment industry. Bassist Matt has toured as a technician with several bands including Pete Doherty, The Rifles, Circa Waves and more. In addition, vocalist Jamie Quinn has also made a name for himself as a TV actor, with big roles in a number of well received TV dramas and comedies.
However, all three members of the band consider music their first love, and the band came together from a mutual desire to shake things up for UK music.

They formed one day watching the Brit awards, realizing together that music needed a ‚Äúnew, real, honest rock n roll band with balls‚Äù. No one who was inspiring them. They had found inspiration in previous generations but there is little around at present. From this epiphany was born Penny Mob ‚Äì a band with the spirit of punk, but the sound of raw indie.

Happy to play anywhere, including impromptu gigs with unsuspecting staff, Penny Mob are building quite the reputation. This new double A-side will go a long way to cementing it further.

‚ÄòMr Generation‚Äô and ‚ÄòWar on the Streets‚Äô are released on May 2nd.

28,The Colossal Heads prepare for colossal new EP ‚ÄòMammoths‚Äô,"New Orleans rockers resurrect Grunge with new release on April 29th

Revelling in the heavier side of indie rock, The Colossal Heads are a group on the rise who have been compared to artists such as Queens of the Stone Age, Incubus, Modest Mouse and Nirvana. These are not bands whose names should be taken lightly in terms of comparison ‚Äì thankfully The Colossal Heads do them justice.
Those bands rose in the 90‚Äôs and early 2000‚Äôs due to a rock genre that had gone from being anti-establishment to part of the norm. In recent years the cycle has started again, and The Colossal Heads are here to shake things up once more. To offer further proof, check out the album lead track ‚ÄòMammoths‚Äô.

https://soundcloud.com/colossalheads/mammoths-2015

Engineered by Louis Cressy, the EP (and single) are a timely reminder of the power that rock music can have.
Another vital part of any musical success is a propensity for hard work, an area in which The Colossal Heads excel almost as much as their song writing. In a prime example, they toured from New Orleans to California from May-June 2015, living out of their Toyota and sleeping on floors along the way. This grass roots approach carries over to their methods of promotion as well. Relying on Facebook, local radio and word of mouth, the band has continued to develop and grow their fan base as their music has become increasingly assured.

‚ÄòMammoths‚Äô is the final result of this evolution, an EP which steps outside of the box and shows how complacent rock music has become in recent times.

121,Buzz Band Disciples of Babylon Returns to Hollywood For A Huge Concert,"Rock act Disciples of Babylon returns to Hollywood to headline their first performance at the world famous Viper Room on Thursday April 28th. 

HOLLYWOOD, CA ‚Äì After the successful release of their critically acclaimed debut EP ‚ÄòWelcome to Babylon‚Äô, Los Angeles based hard rock act, Disciples of Babylon have announced their return to Hollywood in their first headlining performance ever at the world famous Viper Room on Thursday April 28th 2016 in West Hollywood. Special guests include performances by: Nevruary, Duranbah & Bonavox to round out the evenings festivities.

Disciples of Babylon come from Hollywood ‚Äì and so does their sound. Big, broad and epic, their music conjures up the huge stadium bands ‚Äì Muse, Foo Fighters, Queen, The Who, Stone Temple Pilots, U2 and Led Zeppelin.

Disciples of Babylon seek to create music that combines elements from all the major eras in rock ‚Äì delivering the ultimate proof that rock is here to stay.

When vocalist Eric Knight and lead guitarist Ramon Blanco met at an alumni event at the Musicians Institute in 2012, the initial idea for Disciples of Babylon was born. Gui Bodi bassist of the band is also a graduate from the renowned elite music school and drummer Chris Toeller the newest member of the band rounds out the band's line up.

Their debut EP, ‚ÄúWelcome to Babylon‚Äù, was released in September 2015, and was produced by Grammy-winning producer Andres Torres as well as mastered by Grammy-nominated mastering engineer Joe LaPorta, most famous for his work with Foo Fighters, Killers and Vampire Weekend, at the legendary Sterling Sound Studio in New York. The result: world class sound!

Before joining DOB, all the band members had already launched busy pro careers and notched up a slew of indie productions; some had supported bands like Aerosmith, KISS, Dave Matthews Band and Kid Rock.

With a strong lineup and versatile repertoire, they plan to conquer the world with their philosophy of ‚ÄúWelcome you all to Babylon‚Äù.

Disciples of Babylon‚Äôs debut EP, ‚ÄòWelcome to Babylon‚Äô, has been available on all major digital music retailers since last fall. The physical release of the EP will be available in May on the bands official website: www.disciplesofbabylon.com as well as copies for sale at their Viper Room appearance. 

The Viper Room is located 8852 West Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90069 in West Hollywood. Admission is $10, and members of the public 21 years and older are encouraged to attend. For tickets visit: www.viperroom.com

122,Two Rock podcasters on the come up!,"Hello people! Hope you're having a good time.

So... introducing this to you might be the most difficult thing I've ever done in promotion terms (given you literally know nothing about me and my friend) but I'll do my best to pitch this idea correctly hoping you at least give us your much appreciated attention.

Podcasts aren't something new, in fact, there has been a recent explosion of the number of podcasts and people doing them exploded in recent years due to smartphones' ever continuing rise of prominence in people's lives. Me in particular, I've tried this format five years ago, but it didn't work out that well, mainly because I was doing it solo, and there's nothing more boring than someone sniffing his own ass (to my own admission) the whole time... discussion, debate, disagreement and wit are necessary ingredients when it comes to podcasting I believe. And in that, me and my friend Ace (who shall remain anonymous by his own request) decided after enjoying ourselves talking about Hip-Hop that we can branch out to my second and his first favorite genre: Rock.

We're not biased towards or against any sub-genre, everything is welcome in our house, and it is the enjoyability and pure artistic gravatas that decide whether we like something or not.

Of course, it is easy to dismiss and say ""Well, why don't you talk about it in your own private setting ?"" Valid and interesting point, but I guess the main scope here is to open the discussion, through the helpful tool of YouTube -sometime toxic- comments, I hope the podcast isn't just about us fucking around and nothing much else.

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWSrHszkrPkB2HfHO1Vyb0w

PS : The artwork is rusty, and our mics aren't top-notch, but those aren't priorities given it's mainly a side-project for now. My man's gotta earn a come up, and I'm still in my first year of college. The fact we find time to the podcast at all is an achievement.

176,Orca continue to explore the space of prog rock with new single ‚ÄòAquarium‚Äô,"Described as a ‚Äúcracking band‚Äù and praised for their ‚Äúexcellent production values‚Äù by music blog Progrockmusictalk, UK-based alt-rockers Orca have proven to be on top of their game. As pioneers and creators of the mysterious domain of ‚Äòspace metal‚Äô, the five-piece is steadily stepping up to the music industry‚Äôs spotlight.

Their fascination with space and discovering the unknown has always been part of their own musical exploration. By fusing melodic experimentation with hard hitting metal riffs, their new single ‚ÄòAquarium‚Äô (taken from the album ‚ÄòUniverse‚Äô) is a muscular track, effervescing with a forthright and speeding energy. As a follow up to the similarly metal infused guitar styles and contemplative vocals of their first single ‚ÄòAmber‚Äô, this tune is a sensational marvel of progressive rock.

Listen here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4NQ5F8whh8

The song came about when singer Chris started exploring the emotions drawn from the cryptic and riddle-like rhythmic arrangement of a demo recording. ‚ÄòAquarium‚Äô is ultimately about desire, beauty, identity, sensuality, and connecting with the power of nature. The video for the single was shot in a real aquarium which the band describes as a ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù and ‚Äúentrancing‚Äù experience. The album is called ‚ÄòUniverse‚Äô as it was written while the band were travelling separately around the world, with each band member looking out to a different part of the night sky for inspiration.

With influences ranging from Deftones to Tool the band has mastered the techniques of DIY and created a magnificent set of songs with little to no help from other producers. Their music touches upon the deeper questions in life. Orca describes their sound as being about ‚Äúsubmission to the awe and power of the world, and the realization and self-actualization levels of awareness and consciousness.‚Äù Part of their musical diversity stems from the fact that Orca consists of a colourful mixture of different nationalities. Bassist Matt McGuinness is Irish, guitarist David Vezzoli from Italy, other guitarist Ben Murray-Smith from England but born in Brazil, drummer Kacper ""Drum Kid"" Stachowiak
from Poland and singer Chris Edwards is British Armenian. Orca‚Äôs sound reflects this diversity and has been celebrated by radio stations such as KSCR in Los Angeles and Aaron Phillip‚Äôs Amazing Radio Rock Show here in the UK. Musically, they have also come from a variety of backgrounds ranging from psychedelic rock and jazz to heavy metal and synth-pop.

The band has evolved from bassist Matt and guitarist Dave‚Äôs previous project called Martian Time Slip which focused more on a traditional darker kind of metal. After the break up of Martian Time Slip the two collaborators embarked upon new endeavours, forming Orca and searching for the perfect vocalist for the band. Chris approached the band with a style that was both unique and enigmatic. They were struck by his powerful voice and his ability to enrich the melodies with passion much like the late Jeff Buckley. Ben joined shortly afterwards while continuing to write songs for famous Vlogger Casey Neistat. The newest addition to the group is drummer Kacper who has had success with his symphonic power metal band Pathfinder.

The single ‚ÄòAquarium‚Äô is out on 4th March from the album Universe out April 1st

177,"With support from Status Quo to 10cc, pop/rock band W.A.L.E. are proving to be The Netherland‚Äôs finest","‚Äúdynamic arrangements and Beatles/ Sgt. Pepper vibe‚Äù 
‚Äì Detroit Live Magazine -

With the release of their 4th studio album ‚ÄòCome Together‚Äô and positive feedback from fans  in their home country The Netherlands and in the US, W.A.L.E. are a band who merge years of experience with a fresh attitude to songwriting. 

With contributions from 10cc‚Äôs Mick Wilson and acclaimed lead guitarist Tony Hallinan, the album is a well rounded piece of pop perfection. Taking on influences from Tom Petty to Bad Company, Dutch founding members Harry de Waij and Joos van Leeuwen deliver both professionalism as well as an outstanding talent to compose catchy tracks.
The album kicks off with their upcoming single  ‚ÄòNot like another day‚Äô, a catchy classic rock track with an element of pop. This song invites the listener to step out of an ordinary life. Written  a while back in 2002, Harry explains the song is about ‚Äúopening your eyes, believing in yourself and look at your world in different way.‚Äù
Listen here:  https://soundcloud.com/oosvaneeuwen/sets/wale-come-together

W.A.L.E. is a project that came about as a result of dealing with personal loss. Impelled by the passing of one of his friends, Harry recorded his first album. His friend, who used to be a drummer, was initially planning on recording together with Harry. When illness got in the way, Harry decided to make his first record as a tribute to him. It was then he met the musician and producer Joos in a studio in Amsterdam. 

Well-known for his work in The Netherlands, Joos teamed up with Harry to form their band in 2000 which, at that time, went under the name The Early Grey Band. They eventually changed the name to W.A.L.E which is a play on words of the founding members‚Äô last names w de WAij and van LEeuwen.

In 2005, W.A.L.E. embarked on their American tour as Early Grey band, playing in cities like Chicago, Detroit or Madison. 

W.A.L.E. are a band that is full of potential. With fans including Status Quo‚Äôs Francis Rossi  who owns one of their CDs, the band has certainly managed to achieve a fair degree of recognition.  W.A.L.E. have also reached out to legends such as Iggy Pop or Jimmy Page who also own one of their previous records. With ‚ÄòCome Together‚Äô they are now ready to roll on to the UK and beyond. 

The single ‚ÄòNot like another day‚Äô is out on 9th May

178,Darryl Nash expresses colour in sound with debut album ‚ÄòLove Sick‚Äô,"Darryl Nash‚Äôs debut album ‚ÄòLove Sick‚Äô explores the questions of how to treat a broken heart condition and is both sonically colourful and philosophically inquisitive.

Having earned a positive response and support from BBC Introducing South, Darryl Nash is a phenomenal young artist who is about to release an album that takes up the question of whether a broken heart could ever be classified as a serious medical condition. Apart from digging into the depths of love psychology, the multifaceted songwriter has written songs about events that shake up the history of our world, including present day war in the middle east stories  about London‚Äôs Jack The Ripper in 1800, especially in tracks like the dynamic and captivating ‚ÄòThe Murder Chain‚Äô.

'The Murder Chain is a cracking track! ' ‚Äì Melita Dennet (BBC Introducing South)  

Listen here: https://soundcloud.com/darryl-nash-official/the-murder-chain 

Taking inspiration from an eclectic mixture of artists ranging from Lady Gaga to Gary Barlow, Bloc Party or Grimes, the musician is as keen in experimenting with sounds as he is using visual arts as part of his performance. To him, both music and art are ways of telling stories and expressing his emotions: ‚ÄúWhen I say art, for me, I spray, paint and burn musical instruments to express emotion in colour. I feel that the coloured instruments that I play catch people‚Äôs attention and work well with the music I create.‚Äù

Having been passionate about music from an early age on, Darryl formed his first band as early as infant school and remembers: ‚ÄúThere used to be a guy called Pau who used to bully me and a friend of mine. When the Green Day ‚ÄòAmerican Idio‚Äôt album was released we started an air band at the back of the playground and Pau and I argued about who was going to be the drummer.‚Äù The role was eventually taken up by Darryl himself who went home and convinced his mum to buy him his first drum kit. During Junior School, Darryl joined the local church choir and he recorded his first EP when he was only 13 which he promoted himself by playing local shows.  

At that time, he also succeeded in getting a place at BIMM Brighton for further musical studies. He also took part in the ‚ÄòMetal Hammer‚Äô summer school where he was able to play on stage with the likes of Skindred, Radio Alcatraz and James Hester (played for Lily Allen and Tom Robinson‚Äôs live sessions).

As a DIY pro he writes, records and produces all his songs himself. Next to his work as a solo artist, he is also currently playing in a band with Glastonbury punk rocker Peter Wallis.

With his upcoming album, Darryl is touching upon the experience of love sicknesses and provokes the question whether this could actually be classified legitimately as an illness: ‚ÄúAs you know, people do say ‚ÄòPeople die of a broken heart.‚Äô‚Äù

The Album ‚ÄòLove Sick‚Äô is out on 6th May 2016.

Lyrics:

Well, I saw you layin' low,
Hidin' in the dark.
I caught you diggin' graves
In Central Park.
You're all alone, 
I know you'd run.
To shed skin to try and find someone,
To help you,
To forgive you,
To refute everything you've done.
Although you don't even know why you need these changes.
(You can't even change yourself.)
Although I know you're all for takin' chances.
But you'll keep sayin':

I don't want to believe this wicked disease is killin' me.
It's toppled everything I wanted to be.
Now I'm just ashes in the street.

I saw you try to confide in an old friend who already died.
I caught you tearin' holes in stories you've already told.
You would think I'd know by now 
At some point everyone breaks down
and gives up, 
then gives in, 
and sells out all over again.

Although you don't even know why you need these changes.
(Yeah, you can't even change yourself.)
Although I know you're all for takin' chances,
But you'll keep sayin':

I don't want to believe this wicked disease is killin' me.
It's toppled everything I wanted to be.
Now I'm just ashes in the street.

Oh, we all could hope you come home safely 
even though you don't even know why you need to be 
Changin' yourself, 
Changin' yourself,
Changin' yourself,
Changin' yourself.

Nothing Left, 
Nothing Left,

* multiple guitar tracks layered over each other
* guitars using many pedals (especially the wah pedal)
* lots of sliding and bending in the guitar melodies
* lots of sliding in the vocal melodies
* extended jam sessions at the ends of songs
* and, of course, REVERB!

Please post here if you know of any prog rock bands that share any and all of these features.  Thanks for all the help! :)

97,(x-post /r/musictheory) Stevie Nicks and her Demo Recordings,"Hello everyone,

Over in /r/musictheory this month, we are discussing an article about the transformation of Stevie Nicks' demo recordings into studio recordings. This week, we are discussing some features of three demo recordings:

* Gypsy [[Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKIC_Kza4Ek) | [Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX8tFvInN3Y)]

* I Sing for the Things [[Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8l7thWrzS4) | [Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTzC9msamtk)]

* Dreams [[Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpICbfRbDGQ) | [Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrZRURcb1cM)]

**Our discussion thread may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/3m2cwu/aotm_analytical_appetizer_compositional_skeletons/)**

Hough's investigation was prompted by this exchange between Nicks and a fan:

> Susan: What role do you play in the final arrangement of songs, as far as guitar parts, vocal harmonies and any other instrumental parts? Do you write the actual parts yourself?

> Stevie: No, I don‚Äôt. However, when I make my demo‚Äôs [sic] if there is a musical part that I want in the final song, I make sure it‚Äôs in the demo.

The central question we are concerned with, then, is what outline does Nicks provide in her demos? What is she suggesting to her bandmates and collaborators? If we try to forget what we know about the finished products of these songs and then put ourselves into the shoes of her collaborators, what would we have done with these? 

Hough frames the discussion in terms of what he calls ""compositional skeletons."" These are basic relationships that Stevie establishes in the demo between her vocal line, any countermelodies, and the harmonic support. These suggest particular configurations between melody(ies) and harmony/texture that her collaborators can cue into as they craft the final product. 

Our discussion next week will focus on *how* these songs were transformed. How her bandmates listened (or not). But this week, our focus is on the demos as they are.

So, what do we think about them? Both in general and also in relationship to the issues I outlined above. Come join the discussion!",rock,1443026267,nmitchell076,0,1,True,2015-09-23

99,Matchbox 20: Where to start?,"Matchbox 20 was a little before my time, but I was consciously aware of music by the time Rob Thomas started his solo career and loved his albums. Now I'm curious about getting into the band he's in. I remember hearing vague singles from my early childhood on the radio. Late Nineties. 

If anyone could point me in the right direction or give me an order of albums best to worst, that would be great! ",rock,1440483759,JackBlackJackWhite,0,2,True,2015-08-25
32,Can anybody help me found this song / music that sounds like it?,http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yHxPNCVxLyY this video @ 18:26 does anybody know the song or knows music that is similair?,rock,1435874280,kickfloeb,1,6,True,2015-07-02
33,Question: Is there a connection between these two songs?,"Hi,

I'm not a rock music expert, so I wanted to ask you guys about this to see what you think.

I've been getting into the band Clutch lately. At the end of their song ""Escape from the Prison Planet"" (1995), the music fades out as if the track is about to end, but then it humorously fades back in. https://youtu.be/53qeiAVjHQU?t=251

I find this really interesting, because the band Justice did the exact same thing on their track ""Parade"" in 2012. https://youtu.be/QjadKDegjeU?t=190

My question is, do you guys think Justice did this as an homage to Clutch? This seems like a definite possibility to me since both albums share some similarities, and Justice's music does contain other homages to rock bands.

Or maybe it's just a coincidence, and both bands happened to come up with the same idea. Thoughts?",rock,1435899705,WildlifeAnalysis,1,3,True,2015-07-03

‚óè‚ñÇ‚óè .. ‚óèÔ∏ø‚óè .. ‚óèœâ‚óè .. ‚óèÔπè‚óè .. ‚óè‚ñΩ‚óè .. ‚óè‚ñ≥‚óè Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley's mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.	‚óè‚ñÇ‚óè .. ‚óèÔ∏ø‚óè .. ‚óèœâ‚óè .. ‚óèÔπè‚óè .. ‚óè‚ñΩ‚óè .. ‚óè‚ñ≥‚óè

It's been mentioned in a 2010 [NPR](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129855398) story that Hendrix wrote this great song for Linda Keith and they play snippets of it. Naturally I looked it up and found a couple clips on youtube, but they are only about 90 seconds long and don't contain the solo part they play in the interview. 

So where does this recording come from? It was referenced in Hendrix's notes for the album he was working on before he died, [First Rays of the New Rising Sun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Rays_of_the_New_Rising_Sun), but it was not included on the final release. The only collection I've found that has it listed is from a 1989 live radio album, [""Live & Unreleased: The Radio Show""](http://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Live-Unreleased-The-Radio-Show/release/4440806).

This release is  the follow-up from their fan-funded 2012 The Adarna EP. ‚ÄúThe title of How Perceptive refers to gaining perceptions from the experiences in life you‚Äôve had,‚Äù explains guitarist Jasek.

The Adarna are notable for being the first band to coin the genre of Jet City Rock.  This was a way to pay homage to their hometown of Seattle while separating their interactive rock style of music from more over-processed, synthesized music. ‚ÄúWe want the audience to feel the energy pouring off of us and to be part of that energy--not just watch it,‚Äù explains Moore, frontman.
To support the release of How Perceptive, The Adarna will be embarking on their 5th North American tour in July 2015, followed by a Middle East International USO tour to entertain the troops in Dec 2015.  

Album has been made available to download on iTunes, Amazon, CDBaby, and theadarna.com on April 27th, 2015.  For more information see: www.TheAdarna.com

I'm not going to say what happened because it is personal but I will say it wasn't anything small like a broken nail or something like that. This woman was so concerned about everyone else on the room not wanting to bring the mood down, it struck me silent for a moment. So damn caring about everyone else when we all know shit happens.

7,Asking for recommendations on Monster Magnet albums (x-post from /r/hardrock),"Hi!
I've recently discovered Monster Magnet. I first heard ""Dinosaur Vacuum"" when playing Road Rash, and then I heard ""Live for the Moment"" through WWE, and then I heard ""Into the Void"" on Nativity In Black II. I've enjoyed all of these songs, and I went and got myself the 2003 Greatest Hits album to listen to more of Monster Magnet.
However, I believe that sometimes, a Greatest Hits compilation doesn't do justice to the artist. Pink Floyd, for example, sound better when you listen to some albums in their entirety (The Wall and Dark Side of the Moon, for example). So I guess I'm asking for suggestions for one or two albums of MM that I should listen to in their entirety.
When you suggest, please bear in mind that I'm new to MM, I enjoy good riffs, don't care much about lyrics and I generally prefer music that's got a decent recording quality.

Old trams and city noises - you can find all these elements on the new record Dead Trams from the Czech band Anim√©. The band is playing something near alternative rock and prog rock while being present on the scene over a decade. They spent long six years writing the new record with having in mind that a catchy song doesn't need to be primitive and that an artistical attitude to writing doesn't have to be boring.

80,Can you explain what's going on with the guitars and bass in this song?,"Hi reddit. I'd be the first to admit that my taste isn't very sophisticated. One of my favourite bands is the Swedish group Kent, and I wanted to ask you all about one song from an early album of theirs.

1) [What is the lead guitar playing in the intro?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZzDONV6NBI) It has to be pretty simple, but there's something in there I can't put my finger on.

2) What is the difference between the left and right channel? I've split them up for you [here in these linked samples.](https://soundcloud.com/kamiok-ande/sets/intro-channels) Sounds like two guitars playing the same melody, one with more distortion, and there's also a bass - but your eyes are probably better than mine.

Cheers and thanks for your help!

In the 2 years since that video released, we've expanded to a full blown 5 piece band and have toured all over the US and parts of Europe. We've recorded our first full length rock record and are currently still funding it through Kickstarter($1,600 left to raise). We've made a fun video to go along with it and we'd love it you all would take the time and check it out.

2,Top Rock Albums of 2014: Album #1!,"ALBUM #1: Starset ""Transmissions""

So here we are, the best of rock 2014. Starset set out to push rock further then most, and for a brand new group this is no easy task. Their record flows seamlessly, and takes the listener on a journey orchestrated through supernovas and far off galaxies. This space themed group put together so many solid tracks, and placed them together ever so carefully.

[First Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypWvQgnJrSU) introduces us to our space faring voyage, and we take off with [Down with the Fallen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW_FkaXeSwc). Down with the fallen is an excellent opener, showing us what to expect from this new group and all its emotion. Then we reach [Halo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01BsH0p_T8c), a slow moving, but powerful song that was one of my favorites from the start. ""Send out the signal and I'll fly home"". [Carnivore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TkokQjF71Q) brings us back to reality with grisly metaphors. Carnivore certainly deserves the spot as the second single.

[Telescope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vjewxPHq9I) really slows down the voyage, and steps us back to a time of love and loss. [It has Begun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZp3Mtn-YsI) is anything but, as it swirls us back into the depths of the album at a faster pace. Perhaps a new beginning? We then reach the climax, and lead single. [My Demons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkll0StZJLA) catches you and wont let go. Dragging us into ""Nowhere"".

[Antigravity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7qIlpV-uwo) takes us swirling out of control, in a mix of heavy and light sounds. A perfect counter-piece to My Demons. [Dark On Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yntDx4Y4baw) slows you back down into solace, a place of darkness and ill will. From the dark we learn to next [Let It Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJtBYAKBByk). Let It Die takes us towards our final destination, speeding our decent into Starset space.

[The Future is Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRsnxxbGJN8) and [Point Of No Return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTfbLtXTlw) are Starset's more experimental sets, and fall so perfectly into place as the lead in to the grand finale of this trip. [Rise and Fall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHgEwHVzu4s) has all the power and rage you could hope for a finale. After the trip through it all we come out at the end of the album with a sense of accomplishment, and a willingness to take the trip again and again. Everything between songs is well placed to continue the flow and orchestrate the journey.

The orchestration of this album truly sets it apart from all others before it. Starset are proving rock can survive the 2010's, and maybe someday reclaim power over the popular music scene. I'm not afraid to name this the record of the DECADE (so far). It takes skill to make something this amazing and this perfect. Starset set a high bar for themselves and others, and I think they deserve a Grammy for best rock album at the least.

My favorites (in order): My Demons, Halo, Down With The Fallen, Carnivore, Point of No Return, It Has Begun, Let It Die, and Telescope. 10/10's.

Congratulations Starset, from [Rock Is The Best Music](https://www.facebook.com/RockIsTheBestMusic), and thanks for the awesome journey.  \m/

**Nothing More - Self Titled**

Trust me, deciding between album #1 and #2 this year was a hard decision. Nothing More brought a lot to the table. 17 songs! Even not counting the intro, outro and intermissions, we got 13 solid tracks in one amazing album. What surprises me the most is the records breakdown. So lets dive into this one:

The album captures so much emotion, and variety, and the singer experiments with a lot of sounds and ranges.  The album is musically dense and thought provoking, which is why it was my decision for #2 on the year.

The record opens with tracks challenging us to rethink what our governments and religions are doing. The theme for the first third of the album is ""We Are Not Machines"" (used in This is the Time and Christ Copyright). [This is The Time (Ballast)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo5fE-Zl-V4) and [Mr. MTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXxHwOkYEYs) take on corporations while [Christ Copyright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cxsTDnRN7M) questions the church's motives. [First Punch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7NHNRbVJc) seems to mix the two. Nothing More is asking all the right questions and I love their challenge for us to open our eyes to corruption in our society.

After the intermission [Gyre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peWQNa_i5Dw) we delve into a struggling relationship. [The Matthew Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHupH9HcnDg) has remnants of the first section of the album, but moving towards more personal relationships. [I'll Be Ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78pH07RFqmY) and [Here's To The Heartache](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNxD4ekj8_A) show us Nothing More's softer side and the trouble of breakups. I love the lyrics ""How do you love when your heart is broken?"". A lot of emotion in these two songs. [If I Were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_qbEsfJ4_8) seems like our character wants to get back with the lost love, and [Friendly Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c0ZrxjCOko) and [Sex and Lies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joVTfcZ1zP4) show us just how the relationship ends up. [Take a Bullet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNbnmJYQyzs) is the final end to the relationship saga, though it is after the next intermission.

After the next intermission, [Surface Flames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq1RrLM14bk), a remix of ""Friendly Fire"", we return to a theme from Nothing More's first album. The loss of the singers mother to cancer. [Jenny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nInAGkSge9g), my personal favorite, is the sad story of the mother still struggling to raise her daughter and fight to keep her away from drug abuse, but fails in the end before her death. The singer is upset that his sister didn't heed their mother before the end. [God Went North](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0D9GePXQWA) is the singers struggle to cope and accept his mothers death. It challenges his own faith and beliefs, something many can connect with. Heartbreaking song. Finally the album exits on [Pyre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0BCoXnTXw), an instrumental exitlude.

My personal favorites are (in order): Jenny, Friendly Fire, I'll Be Ok, This Is The Time (Ballast), Mr. MTV, Christ Copyright, If I Were, Sex and Lies, Here's To The Heartache, and The Matthew Effect. 

Thoughts and criticism are appreciated!  I know my interpretations of some songs may differ from yours, and that's ok!  Let's discuss this amazing album.

I recently stopped listening to EDM/Dubstep (sometimes but very rarely now) and got back into rock, blues, and all kinds of music played with instruments. I often share what I'm listening to at work (people walk in and hear my music) with customers, but it's very rare that any of them have suggestions for me that I haven't already heard.

I thought we could make a thread in which we post what albums we like and what we would like to hear more of (doesn't have to be that similar, but often knowing that someone likes a certain album can bring to mind another album that they might hopefully like as well).

It can be any genre, including EDM, although most people don't listen to that in album form, and I would really like for this to remain album exclusive, because I find bands that produce entire albums that are good to be more worth my time listening to, not having to change the song very often, etc.
Feel free to post what you like, or to recommend stuff to others. An upvote for visibility would be greatly appreciated! I will go first by listing albums I have been listening to. I'll try to list the more obscure ones, but I'll also include some well known ones.

4 Band of Gypsys - Jimi Hendrix (Heavy/intense guitar)

Acquiring The Taste - Gentle Giant (Trippy rock, very trippy at some points)

All Rights Removed - Airbag (Very smooth progressive rock)

American Woman - The Guess Who (Classic rock)

Virtually every Pink Floyd album, here are my favorites in random order; Animals, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, The Wall, The Division Bell, Meddle, Momentary Lapse of Reason.

Aqualung - Jethro Tull (AMAZING rock with flute!)

Then Play On - Fleetwood Mac (Blues)

Demon Dayz - Gorillaz

Dragonfly - Frank Marino & Mahogany Rush (great Montreal Jimi Hendrix like rock)

In Absentia - Porcupine Tree (mostly heavy rock)

Voyage 34 - Porcupine Tree (VERY psychedelic rock, LSD themed album)

In the Court of the Crimson King - King Crimson (Rock)

L.A. Woman - The Doors (rock, they have a unique style though)

Led Zeppelin IV (rock)

Original Sin - Carolyn Fe Blues Collective (Montreal blues group)

Permanent Waves - Rush (more Canadian rock)

Rock & Roll Machine - Triumph (EPIC rock, sounds like AC/DC minus any screaming and nonsense. Epic solos. Epic drummer)

The Seldom Seen Kid - Elbow (mostly soft, some very good rock too. I only like the rock, lol)

True to the Blues - Johnny Winter (Amazing blues guitarist, happens to be albino)

Aretha Franklin (any of her music)

Who's Next - The Who (classic rock)

68,Possible Revival of Rock and Roll.,"     Hello everyone, my name is Luke Schaffel and I would like to offer you something to think about. What is the current state of Rock 'n' Roll? Are there any great bands touring and releasing killer albums every year with large fan bases? And when I say rock, I mean rock, not pop punk, not alternative, not country rock not hardcore. I'm talking straight up rock hard rock 'n' roll. If you are like me, you are horribly disgusted at some of the music on various musical media like soundcloud and bandcamp that calls itself rock. Now sure, some of the old bands that we all know and love are still around and kickin', but where is the youth? Where are the new fans? Where are the kids buying tickets and painting their faces to go scream their lungs out at their idols on stage? The state of the music industry is that huge record labels are creating these ""celebrities"" to put out one or two songs, make as much money as possible, and inevitably drop off the face of the earth in a few years. With all of this going on there is no room left for the likes of us, the people who actually love music for the good music, not blindly following people who these colossal record companies tell us that we should like because they are attractive and rich.
     This is where I offer us all a way that might change it. Below I am going to link you all to a new band that would love to have a part in changing all of this. I know that it would seem that this has just changed into a shameless self promotion of my band, because yes, I am in it, but it is about the bigger picture. If one rock band is able to break through all the imperfections of the current state of music and become respected, than what is stopping rockers like us from taking back the pop culture? This band, who goes by the name of ""The Clocktown Giants"" is straight up rock n roll. No drum machine, no auto tune, no bull shit. I am not going to talk too much about it, I will let you check it out for yourselves.  If we are all going to make the music scene better for all of us, we need your help. Spread the word, show your friends, and more importantly, ROCK ON!!!

23,500 Rock Bands (500),"Hey everybody,

Awhile ago I posted on here seeing if there was any interest in me doing a weekly (or so) review of the bands in this book I have called ""500 Rock Bands"" by Joanne Huffa. I will be starting from the back of of the book and will be going forward talking about the bands and my favorite songs. For this first installation I'll only have one band, but I'll have 5 groups per post in the rest. I hope you guys enjoy! Ps. Feel free to comment on things you'd like to see or change.

#500. Atomic Rooster (1969):

Notes from the book- Ex members of Crazy World of Author Brown created this band, yet the only consistent member was Vincent Crane (the keyboardist)

My thoughts- They don't call these guys Atomic for nothing! A prog-rock group with a crunchy tone that uses a horn section and keys to blow out your speakers, Atomic Rooster is a mix of King Crimson kickass-ness and Jethro Tull-esque vocals. A lot of simple riffs, a lot of psychedelic jams, not much else to say other than wow! I had never heard of these guys before, but I will definitely add them to my list of bands to dive into.

I do not believe rock n roll will die anytime soon but it certainly is harder to find. I cant rely on the radio to show me good new bands because rap and pop are the main genres in the public's ears right now, which is cool, i like it all when done right. but as a rock n roll musician myself i find it impossible to find the latest music. How do i find all those bands that are amazing but nobody's ever heard because they haven't broke out commercially yet? I try things like Pandora and spottily and those things work to an extent. but there's still a spot in my ears unfulfilled. and as a musician i feel detached from my craft for the fact that there is so much music out there i haven't heard. i want to be a part of my generation.. So Please people..help me get hip.

Some bands that i like that have ""commercial"" success are like the black keys, jack white, cage the elephant. the stokes. I want to get SOO much deeper. thank yo.

36,[X-post from TOMT] Looking for an upbeat rock duet with one male and one female vocals singing back and forth,"Hi /r/rock,

I've been searching for an upbeat rock song possibly (but not limited to) released between the 90s to mid-2000s. This song is sung by a deep, raspy male vocal and a sweet, high pitch female vocal. The male vocal opens the song and immediately the female vocal responses. The two vocals sing back and forth continuously, if I remembered it correctly. The only part of the lyrics I remember is the word ""justice"" or ""rejoice"" or something similar to that, sung by the female. 

Here are some details about this song:

- The tune sounds a bit like this:

Male: G-8, G-8, D-15, D-15, C-13, C-13, D-15

Female: C-49, A#-47, C-49, A#-47, A-46, G-44, G-44, A#-47, G-44

- The atmosphere of the song is a bit dark, but upbeat

- This song has a strong bass playing in the background

- This song is definitely definitely released before 2006


Please let me know if you can find this song!!!

43,White Denim puts on one hell of a show,"I wanted to write a quick review of the concert I went to about a week ago.  It was at the iconic Fillmore theatre in SF and the band was White Denim. If you haven't heard of them, they're a four-piece rock band that I think is just starting to rise in popularity. Although for all I know they're probably already pretty well known on this sub. You can find their music on spotify to check it out. 

The Fillmore is an awesome venue for this kind of music. No frills, no special effects, just the band up in front of a general admission group of people ranging from sixteen year olds to fifty-somethings. Pot is prevalent, but try to not mooch off others; bring your own if you want to toke. 

The band itself was absolutely incredible. After a nice Japanese dinner at japan town in SF (in order to skip the incredibly underwhelming opening band) standing in the crowd seemed like it was going to be an ordeal, but they made the entire two plus hours fly by. I couldn't believe how sad I was when it finished. They played song after song, often moving without pause into the next, all recognizable but with the kind of live embellishment that makes it oh-so-worthwhile to go see a band live. And man, that rhythm section. I'm no musician, but even I could tell that the bassist and drummer were doing incredible things to keep the two guitars playing off each other and on time. Really, it was flawless and incredibly impressive. 

I've been listening to them nonstop for a week because of this show. Forgive the cliche, but it blew my mind. For thirty bucks, you don't want to miss their two plus hour show.

95,I wanted to share some of my lyrics with you guys.,"So I do consider myself a gifted lyricist and I decided to share some of my lyrics with you guys. Feel free to like or dislike them. 

I wrote this song about once being a kid, and having to one day live a full life of a man, like a life story:

I forget my earliest days/
A blur of childlike fantasy/
Its all just a seemingly endless phase/
Of a time when the world left its most innocent memories/

Live the life, of a normal child/
Buy a basketball, shoot hoops every once in a while/
An average life of growing up, just to sometimes remember/
the friends you used to play with, and the memories that last forever/

As I get older, the memories will pile up/
Like the stacks of files in my office, that remind me that I've given up/
The crazy times as a young man, and the silly regrets/
And the aging moments with my loved ones, as I remember the world I grew up in,/
that make me look around at whats left/

My times in high school, figuring out my place/
While I wasted my time, worrying about my mistakes/
To the times that I cried as my children grew/
And as I watched them gradually make sense of this world/
Like I did, but with their own point of view/


I wrote this one about the cruel and sick world we live in based on the bad intentions of humans and life:

I walked along the street/
I saw a kid get beat/
They left him on the street to bleed/
This world scares me/

I walked on lands found far/
I saw a child starve/
The little boy looked at me/
and said ""This world scares me""/

My dad went over seas/
To serve our country/
He couldn't come home, in one piece/
This world scares me/

I traveled far away/
I had to get away/
I went out into the country/
This world can't hurt me/
I don't travel alone because/
My dad is still with me/
This world has not yet/
Gotten the best of me/

I walked around the block/
I saw a man get shot/
This whole wide world, is not the land of the free/

http://marcsmithmusic.com/tagged/songs

Can you support the troops, and not support war?

Marc Smith releases a grim, but rocking, portrait of war and its aftermath this Veteran's Day titled ""Alligators and Snakes"". 

Marc Smith:
""This is a homecoming song but not a joyous one. Alligators and Snakes is my¬† assessment of the situation; a culture of paranoia bent on eradicating its own fear, where politics is a hamster wheel, and television the slow drip. ¬†

I wish as much honor were paid to those servicemen and women who speak out against the horrors of war as those who died or have been ruined by it. ¬†I'm outraged by politicians who escape honest debate with sloganeering like ""support our troops"". ¬†Do you know¬†anyone¬†who doesn't implicitly support the valiant people defending our liberty every day? ¬†I don't. ¬†For politicians to conflate opposition to war with antipathy for our armed forces is gross and demeaning to those who serve. ¬†I believe¬†the troops¬†are more critical of our leaders than anyone and fearful of their judgement. ¬†They're the ones who have to carry out orders, be they reckless or well considered. ¬†They have the most to lose and are the most qualified to speak up for peace.
I use alligators and snakes as the metaphor because they are a universally sinister archetype, extraordinarily patient and calculating, similar in nature to psychological warfare. ¬†We're more terrified of their surreptitious movement and potential to strike than the blow itself. ¬†But like the drone circling above, when the attack comes it's devastating and violent.""

9,"I was playing Stairway to Heaven, and my friend called it shitty music and wanted me to turn it off. Do any of you redditors have similar stories like this?","Let me give a little background on this. My friend only listens to screamo/emo music (Pierce the Veil, etc), and hates every other kind of music. Rap, Classic Rock, Metal, Hip-Hop, even Jazz. This has happened numerous occasions, even stating he'd rather listen to Of Mice and Men than Bohemian Rhapshody. So anyways, I turned on a playlist of songs, and Stairway started to play, and my friend was like ""Why are you playing shitty music, let me play mine"". Now, this is an opinionative post, and not everyone will agree, but honestly, if you call almost every popular Classic Rock band shitty, something is wrong with you, especially if you listen to ""rock"". If you listen to other music, like Rap, I don't care, and screamo fans can have their opinion, but it really pisses me off when my friend calls my music shitty, and he goes batshit insane when I say I hate screamo.

* My favorite live show ever is [Alter Bridge - Live in Amsterdam](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6F258069356F2F43). The Show is from 2008, when the band were touring their second disk, Blackbird. This is one of the best vocal performances I've ever seen from a rock singer, and the rest of the band are phenomenal as well.

* [Led Zep - Celebration Day](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHAlHeCAYTs). Doesn't get much better than this. The band are still great, as are the songs. he highlight is the long high note near the end of Kashmir where Robert Plant remembers who he is.

* [Steelheart - Live in Osaka.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ65A8A18dA) Steelheart were a glam band that got a record deal right before Nirvana ruined hairstyles in rock forever. As such, no one's ever heard of them. This gig has some dodgy moments, but it's a great example of late-day glam rock. The singer was the voice of Mark Wahlberg in the Rockstar movie.

* [The Who - Live at the Royal Albert Hall.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCWzPrwBTW8) The Who are awesome, and so is this concert. Roger Daltrey's voice has held up well, despite being 4012 year old. Great moment around the 2 hour mark, where the lead guitarist from Oasis comes onstage and play Won't Get Fooled Again with the band.

* [Yeah, fuckin' sue me, I like this band.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hwbq5ub1DW4) Say what you want about their integrity, but this is a great performance. They are tight as all hell and the singing is perfect.

34,"x-post from r/music, I want your thoughts on this. What would you guys think of my band selling our music on SD's instead of CD's? Cheaper than iTunes with CD quality. Please read :)","Alright, so hey. I'm a musician. I've been thinking about a bunch of stuff lately, but one of the things I've been focused on has been music distribution and making it easier and less expensive to get legal music on a hard copy. CD's are inefficient and quite expensive, so this is my idea.
When my band starts to make and distribute music, we will buy bulk SD cards of 1GB or less, use our own computers to load about ~12 tracks in FLAC format + album art + digital booklets onto them (which shouldn't be too hard seeing as SD cards copy extremely fast), then distribute these, with the same quality and everything as a CD or iTunes download, for $5.
If we had our album on iTunes for $9.99, on CD at shows for $10/online for $15, or SD's with the album for $5 both online and at shows, which would you buy? Keep in mind that you'd also save money on shipping by buying the smaller item.
If my calculations are correct, bulk SD's should come out to about $.70 apiece, which would mean $4.30 of profit per SD. This is a HUGE profit margin compared to a CD, even when selling the CD for twice as much.
Well, Reddit? What do you think?
If you like the idea, please leave a comment and give me an upvote. This is a self post, so no karma will be whored. If you DISLIKE the idea, please do not downvote as I want to get this idea to as many people as I can and hear opinions. Instead of downvoting, please, I implore you as one redditor to another, leave a comment stating why you dislike this and why you think it's not a good idea.
As a music fan, I think it's a better alternative to iTunes downloads and CD's because it's less money.
As a musician and businessman, I think it's a better alternative to either as I'm getting more profit for what I'm giving and I'm helping my band's fans get my music for cheaper, increasing the band's popularity.
Personally, I will always buy CD's as they are my favorite, but I want opinions from the music-loving populous. Thank you for reading and giving input ",rock,1354494495,Tazthewonderdog,7,5,True,2012-12-02

16,"Muse -- ""Execution Commentary"" [early B-side]","2:32 of a great band at their most berzerk and anarchic; totally different from their later stuff!  They haven't played this one live in many years, but they still play the ""EC"" riff on occasion, most recently about a month ago.

The video begins with a collection of assorted pics at first and switches over to unrelated (but similarly extreme) gig footage, but it's well sync'ed with the music.
